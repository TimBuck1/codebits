1. How does Spring Boot autoconfiguration work internally, and how can you override or customize specific autoconfigurations?
Explanation: Spring Boot’s autoconfiguration feature automatically configures beans based on the classpath and environment settings. To answer this, explain how @EnableAutoConfiguration, META-INF/spring.factories, and the @ConditionalOnClass annotations work. Also, talk about how to override specific beans and configurations, like using the exclude attribute or providing custom configurations in a @Configuration class.
2. How would you secure a Spring Boot REST API using Spring Security, and what are the steps for implementing JWT-based authentication?
Explanation: To answer this, walk through the key concepts of Spring Security, such as security filters, configuring security in a WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, and applying JWT for stateless authentication. Discuss how to create filters for JWT token validation, user authentication, and authorization.
3. What are the pros and cons of using embedded servers (like Tomcat) in Spring Boot applications, and how do you switch between different embedded servers?
Explanation: Embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow are one of Spring Boot's key features. Discuss the advantages (e.g., self-contained application) and disadvantages (e.g., complexity when scaling). Explain how to switch between embedded servers by modifying dependencies in the pom.xml or build.gradle file and configuring relevant properties.
4. How would you manage transactions in a distributed microservice architecture using Spring Boot, considering ACID properties and eventual consistency?
Explanation: Dive into distributed transactions and how Spring Boot manages transactions via @Transactional. Discuss the challenges of maintaining ACID properties in a microservice environment and the need for eventual consistency, highlighting patterns like the Saga pattern or using tools like Kafka for event-driven transactions.
5. How does Spring Boot manage application configuration using the application.properties or application.yml files, and how would you handle profiles, externalized configuration, and environment-specific overrides?
Explanation: Explain how Spring Boot manages hierarchical configurations using application.properties or application.yml. Talk about the use of profiles (e.g., @Profile, spring.profiles.active) for environment-specific configuration and how Spring Boot prioritizes properties (e.g., from externalized configuration like environment variables, command-line arguments, or config server).
Bonus:
What are some common performance bottlenecks in Spring Boot applications, and how would you optimize a high-traffic application?

Discuss areas like inefficient database access, unnecessary bean creation, memory management, and how tools like Spring Boot Actuator and caching solutions (e.g., Redis, Ehcache) help optimize performance.
These questions test knowledge of Spring Boot’s internal workings, advanced configurations, and real-world application design strategies.


1. What are the key features introduced in Java 17 (LTS), and how do they differ from Java 11 (LTS)?
Explanation: Java 17 is the next Long-Term Support (LTS) release after Java 11. You should discuss features like:
Sealed Classes (Java 17): Explain how sealed classes limit which other classes can extend or implement them.
Pattern Matching for instanceof (Java 16): Simplifies type casting in instanceof checks.
Records (Java 16): A new way to define immutable data classes with minimal boilerplate.
Text Blocks (Java 13): Multi-line strings without the need for excessive escaping.
Switch Expressions (Java 12): Allows switch statements to return values.
Removal of deprecated features: Like finalizing the removal of RMI Activation, and deprecating Applets for removal.
2. Explain the usage and benefits of Virtual Threads introduced in Project Loom (Java 21). How do they differ from platform threads, and what problem do they solve?
Explanation: Virtual threads are a major feature in Java 21 introduced as part of Project Loom. They are lightweight, user-mode threads that can handle a large number of tasks concurrently without the overhead of traditional platform threads.
Discuss how virtual threads map many Java threads to fewer OS threads and their impact on improving concurrency, simplifying asynchronous programming (i.e., avoiding complex callback-based async code).
Explain the differences from platform threads and how virtual threads improve resource management in I/O-bound tasks.
3. What are Records in Java, and how do they impact the design of immutable objects? Explain the key differences between a Record and a traditional Java class.
Explanation: Records are a new feature introduced in Java 14 (as a preview) and stabilized in Java 16. Discuss how Record is a concise way to declare a class that is meant to be immutable and holds data.
Explain how the compiler generates constructors, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods automatically for Records.
Compare the verbose traditional class approach and highlight how Record enforces immutability and prevents mutable state.
4. What is Pattern Matching for switch (introduced in Java 21), and how does it differ from previous switch enhancements (Java 12-17)?
Explanation: Java 21 expands on previous switch enhancements by adding pattern matching to switch. You should discuss how this feature enables matching against both type and structure (e.g., deconstructing objects) directly in the switch statement.
Explain how pattern matching works with sealed classes, records, and type hierarchies.
Discuss how it differs from previous switch changes, such as switch expressions and the yield keyword (Java 12), and how it simplifies code that would otherwise require instanceof and casting logic.
5. What are Scoped Values (introduced in Java 21), and how do they improve handling of shared state across threads in a concurrent environment?
Explanation: Scoped values are a new concept introduced in Java 21 to offer an alternative to thread-local storage. Scoped values provide immutable shared state that is safe to use across threads.
Discuss how scoped values avoid the downsides of thread-local variables, such as leakage and lifecycle management complexity.
Explain how this feature simplifies passing data through method calls or across async operations while maintaining thread-safety.
Bonus:
How do Foreign Function & Memory API (Java 19-21) enhancements improve Java's ability to interact with native code, and what problem does it solve compared to JNI?

The Foreign Function & Memory API allows Java programs to call native libraries and handle memory directly, replacing the cumbersome JNI (Java Native Interface). You should discuss the benefits, such as easier access to native code, safer memory management, and performance improvements.


Question:
Scenario: You are working with a trading system that processes different types of trades such as StockTrade, BondTrade, and ForexTrade. Each trade type has a method to calculate fees and apply discounts based on various business rules. The business wants the ability to extend these operations in the future without modifying the trade classes themselves (i.e., follow the Open-Closed Principle).

How would you implement the Visitor Design Pattern to achieve this flexibility, allowing new operations to be easily added to the trade classes without modifying them?

Answer:
The Visitor Design Pattern allows you to add new functionality to classes without changing their structure. In this case, we can define a TradeVisitor interface for operations that will be applied to different types of trades (StockTrade, BondTrade, and ForexTrade). Each trade class will accept a visitor that can perform the necessary operation (e.g., calculate fees, apply discounts).

Here's a Java implementation of this pattern:

Step 1: Define the Trade interface and its concrete implementations
java
Copy code
// Trade.java (Element Interface)
public interface Trade {
    void accept(TradeVisitor visitor);
}

// StockTrade.java (Concrete Element)
public class StockTrade implements Trade {
    private double price;
    private int quantity;

    public StockTrade(double price, int quantity) {
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    @Override
    public void accept(TradeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// BondTrade.java (Concrete Element)
public class BondTrade implements Trade {
    private double faceValue;
    private double interestRate;

    public BondTrade(double faceValue, double interestRate) {
        this.faceValue = faceValue;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    public double getFaceValue() {
        return faceValue;
    }

    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }

    @Override
    public void accept(TradeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// ForexTrade.java (Concrete Element)
public class ForexTrade implements Trade {
    private String currencyPair;
    private double exchangeRate;

    public ForexTrade(String currencyPair, double exchangeRate) {
        this.currencyPair = currencyPair;
        this.exchangeRate = exchangeRate;
    }

    public String getCurrencyPair() {
        return currencyPair;
    }

    public double getExchangeRate() {
        return exchangeRate;
    }

    @Override
    public void accept(TradeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
Step 2: Define the TradeVisitor interface and its implementations
java
Copy code
// TradeVisitor.java (Visitor Interface)
public interface TradeVisitor {
    void visit(StockTrade stockTrade);
    void visit(BondTrade bondTrade);
    void visit(ForexTrade forexTrade);
}

// FeeCalculationVisitor.java (Concrete Visitor for calculating fees)
public class FeeCalculationVisitor implements TradeVisitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(StockTrade stockTrade) {
        double fee = stockTrade.getPrice() * stockTrade.getQuantity() * 0.01; // 1% fee
        System.out.println("StockTrade Fee: " + fee);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(BondTrade bondTrade) {
        double fee = bondTrade.getFaceValue() * bondTrade.getInterestRate() * 0.005; // 0.5% fee
        System.out.println("BondTrade Fee: " + fee);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(ForexTrade forexTrade) {
        double fee = forexTrade.getExchangeRate() * 0.002; // 0.2% fee
        System.out.println("ForexTrade Fee: " + fee);
    }
}

// DiscountVisitor.java (Concrete Visitor for applying discounts)
public class DiscountVisitor implements TradeVisitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(StockTrade stockTrade) {
        double discount = stockTrade.getPrice() * 0.05; // 5% discount
        System.out.println("StockTrade Discount: " + discount);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(BondTrade bondTrade) {
        double discount = bondTrade.getFaceValue() * 0.03; // 3% discount
        System.out.println("BondTrade Discount: " + discount);
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(ForexTrade forexTrade) {
        double discount = forexTrade.getExchangeRate() * 0.01; // 1% discount
        System.out.println("ForexTrade Discount: " + discount);
    }
}
Step 3: Using the Visitor in the application
java
Copy code
public class TradeVisitorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create some trade objects
        Trade stockTrade = new StockTrade(100.0, 50); // price = 100, quantity = 50
        Trade bondTrade = new BondTrade(1000.0, 0.07); // face value = 1000, interest rate = 7%
        Trade forexTrade = new ForexTrade("EUR/USD", 1.2); // exchange rate = 1.2

        // Create visitors
        TradeVisitor feeVisitor = new FeeCalculationVisitor();
        TradeVisitor discountVisitor = new DiscountVisitor();

        // Apply fee calculation
        stockTrade.accept(feeVisitor);
        bondTrade.accept(feeVisitor);
        forexTrade.accept(feeVisitor);

        System.out.println("----");

        // Apply discount
        stockTrade.accept(discountVisitor);
        bondTrade.accept(discountVisitor);
        forexTrade.accept(discountVisitor);
    }
}
Output:
yaml
Copy code
StockTrade Fee: 50.0
BondTrade Fee: 35.0
ForexTrade Fee: 0.0024
----
StockTrade Discount: 5.0
BondTrade Discount: 30.0
ForexTrade Discount: 0.012
Explanation:
Trade Classes: Each trade type (StockTrade, BondTrade, ForexTrade) implements the Trade interface and provides an accept() method for visitors to visit them.
TradeVisitor Interface: The TradeVisitor interface defines operations that can be performed on trades. This interface can be extended to add new behaviors without modifying the trade classes.
Concrete Visitors: The FeeCalculationVisitor and DiscountVisitor implement the operations to calculate fees and apply discounts to the trades.
Extensibility: If a new operation (e.g., logging, auditing) needs to be added in the future, you can simply create a new visitor without modifying any of the existing trade classes.
This solution follows the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), as it allows extending behavior without changing existing code.
