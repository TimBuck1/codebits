My SpringBoot application has controller test and a Cucumber test. I introduced Embedded Kafka and maybe also Kafka Consumer and Producer. Initially the test used to work fine when a clean install was done using Maven. All the tests, Cucumber as well as controller tests, the controllers are reactive controllers. Now the Cucumber tests go through fine, but the controller tests fail.
ChatGPT said:

Since you introduced Embedded Kafka and possibly Kafka Consumer/Producer components into your Spring Boot application, and now your controller tests are failing while Cucumber tests pass, here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Context Initialization Issues
Problem: Adding Embedded Kafka might be impacting the Spring context initialization order. Some beans (e.g., Kafka-related configurations) might be causing blocking operations or altering the context expected by your reactive controllers.

Solution: Ensure that the test configuration for Embedded Kafka is correctly scoped by using @TestConfiguration and limiting its application to tests that require it.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestConfiguration
public class KafkaTestConfig {
    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory() {
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(/* your Kafka properties here */);
    }
}
Then use @Import(KafkaTestConfig.class) selectively in tests that require Kafka.

2. Spring Profiles for Test Isolation
Problem: Your Cucumber and controller tests might be running under the same Spring profile, causing unintended dependencies to load.

Solution: Separate test configurations by using Spring profiles.

In application-test.yml or application.properties:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
Then, activate it in your controller test:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
3. Blocking Behavior in Reactive Controllers
Problem: Adding Kafka Consumers might be causing blocking behavior, which conflicts with your reactive stack.

Solution: Ensure that any Kafka operations (e.g., producing/consuming) do not introduce blocking calls. Use @EnableReactiveKafka if you're using Project Reactor.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@EnableReactiveKafka
@Configuration
public class ReactiveKafkaConfig {
}
4. Test Execution Order
Problem: If the Cucumber tests run first, they might leave an altered state, affecting the subsequent controller tests.

Solution: Run tests independently by controlling test order using Maven:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=ControllerTest
Or in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <includes>
            <include>**/*CucumberTest.java</include>
            <include>**/*ControllerTest.java</include>
        </includes>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
5. Context Caching and Isolation
Problem: Spring caches the context across tests, and Embedded Kafka may introduce unintended dependencies.

Solution: Use @DirtiesContext to force context reloading:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
6. Mock Kafka for Controller Tests
Problem: If your controller tests don't need Kafka, avoid initializing it unnecessarily.

Solution: Use @MockBean to mock Kafka components in tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@MockBean
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;
7. Test Dependencies Conflict
Problem: Dependencies added for Kafka (like Jackson serialization settings, reactive streams, etc.) might interfere with WebFlux tests.

Solution: Verify pom.xml for dependency conflicts and exclusions.

Example:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Next Steps
Run the controller tests in isolation with debug logs enabled:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.kafka=DEBUG
Check the exact error message from the failing tests and adjust configurations accordingly.

If you provide the exact failure message from your tests, I can help diagnose the issue further.

You said:
Consumer producers used are not Kafka, those are basic Apache clients.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since your application uses basic Apache clients for consumer-producer functionality and not Kafka, but the introduction of Embedded Kafka has caused controller tests to fail while Cucumber tests pass, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Embedded Kafka Unintended Context Influence
Problem: Embedded Kafka might be interfering with the Spring application context, especially in the controller tests that do not need it.

Solution: Use conditional loading or separate test configurations.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestConfiguration
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "test.kafka.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public class EmbeddedKafkaConfig {
    // Kafka configuration beans
}
Then, in your test:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "test.kafka.enabled=true")
public class CucumberTest {
}
2. Spring Context Isolation for Tests
Problem: If the same application context is shared across Cucumber and controller tests, Embedded Kafka may alter beans unexpectedly.

Solution: Use @DirtiesContext to reload the context for the controller tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
Or, separate test classes into different packages and isolate test contexts:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = ControllerTestConfig.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
3. Incorrect Test Dependencies
Problem: The introduction of Embedded Kafka might have pulled in additional dependencies that conflict with the Apache client-based consumers/producers.

Solution: Review your pom.xml to ensure no conflicting dependencies exist.

Example (if using Spring Boot):

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
If you're not using Kafka in production but only for tests, ensure it's scoped correctly.

4. Blocking vs Non-Blocking Behavior
Problem: If the Apache consumers/producers are synchronous (blocking), they might not integrate well with reactive controllers.

Solution: Consider wrapping synchronous operations using Mono.fromCallable() or Schedulers.boundedElastic() for better compatibility with WebFlux.

java
Copy
Edit
public Mono<String> handleRequest() {
    return Mono.fromCallable(() -> apacheProducer.send("message"))
               .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
}
5. Controller Test Specific Fixes
Ensure your controller tests are running with the correct WebFlux configuration.

java
Copy
Edit
@WebFluxTest(controllers = MyReactiveController.class)
public class MyControllerTest {
}
Mock Apache producer/consumer components instead of using real ones:

java
Copy
Edit
@MockBean
private ApacheProducer apacheProducer;
6. Run Tests Individually
Run the controller tests separately from the Cucumber tests to see if they fail in isolation:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=ControllerTest
If you have any specific error messages from the failing controller tests, sharing those would help pinpoint the issue further.

You said:
I have a doubt that Embedded Kafka does not exit even after the Cucumber test is done. Now, I am using addEmbeddedKafka annotation. How will I know which Bean actually implements this particular annotation underlying, and how can I access it and maybe destroy it in the step definitions pre-destroyed?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're using the @EmbeddedKafka annotation in your tests and suspect that the Embedded Kafka instance persists even after the Cucumber tests complete, you can follow these steps to determine which bean is managing it and how to properly stop or destroy it.

1. Understanding @EmbeddedKafka Annotation
The @EmbeddedKafka annotation is provided by spring-kafka-test and sets up an embedded Kafka broker within the Spring context. The underlying implementation typically creates a KafkaEmbedded or EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean.

Example usage:

java
Copy
Edit
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = {"test-topic"})
@SpringBootTest
public class KafkaTest {
}
2. Identifying the Bean
You can identify the bean that manages Embedded Kafka by:

Injecting and inspecting it directly in your test class.
Using the Spring application context to list all available beans.
Example: Injecting Embedded Kafka Bean
Try injecting the possible underlying bean types:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;
If this bean exists, it confirms the component managing Kafka.

Example: List All Beans in Context
In a test step or before destroying, you can inspect which beans are registered:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

@Test
public void listAllBeans() {
    String[] beanNames = applicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames();
    Arrays.sort(beanNames);
    for (String beanName : beanNames) {
        System.out.println("Bean: " + beanName + " -> " + applicationContext.getBean(beanName).getClass().getName());
    }
}
Look for any beans related to EmbeddedKafkaBroker or KafkaEmbedded.

3. Destroying Embedded Kafka in @PreDestroy
If you want to manually stop the embedded Kafka instance when Cucumber tests finish, you can add a @PreDestroy method inside a step definition or a test configuration class:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class KafkaShutdownHook {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownEmbeddedKafka() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down Embedded Kafka...");
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    }
}
Ensure this class is loaded in your test context.

4. Manual Cleanup in Cucumber Hooks
You can also manually stop the Kafka broker inside a Cucumber @AfterAll or @BeforeAll hook.

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class TestHooks {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        System.out.println("Tearing down Embedded Kafka...");
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    }
}
5. Using @DirtiesContext for Cleanup
To automatically clean up the application context after tests, you can use:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
This forces a context refresh after the test class execution, ensuring that the embedded Kafka instance is shut down.

6. Checking Kafka Ports for Persistence
To verify if the Kafka broker is still running after tests, you can check the assigned ports:

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println("Kafka Broker Running on Ports: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
If the ports are still active after tests, it indicates that Kafka is not shutting down properly.

Summary
To ensure proper cleanup of Embedded Kafka:

Identify the bean using ApplicationContext.
Inject EmbeddedKafkaBroker and manually destroy it.
Use @PreDestroy or Cucumber @AfterAll for cleanup.
Leverage @DirtiesContext to reset the test context.
Monitor Kafka broker ports to confirm shutdown.
If you're still facing persistence issues, try running tests individually and check for memory leaks or hanging threads related to the embedded broker.

You said:
So, one of the things I tried was, I actually auto-wired Embedded Kafka in StepDev, and in its pre-destroy, tried to check if it is not null, and if it is not null, basically call the destroy method. But I got it as null there. Is it the right way if in the Cucumber StepDev, I do this?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker in your Cucumber step definitions (StepDev) and found it to be null, it indicates that the Spring context in which your step definitions are running does not have access to the bean or it is not managed properly within the same application context.

Why the Bean Might Be null
Different Contexts:

Cucumber and Spring Boot might not share the same context unless explicitly configured to do so.
Step definitions might not be registered as Spring-managed beans unless annotated correctly.
Lifecycle Timing:

If the bean is instantiated after the step definitions are initialized, it may not be available yet.
Incorrect Bean Scope:

The bean may not be available due to a mismatch in test configuration scopes.
Solution Approaches
1. Ensure Step Definitions Are Spring-Managed Beans
Make sure that your Cucumber step definition class is registered as a Spring bean by annotating it with:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class StepDev {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanUp() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            System.out.println("Shutting down Embedded Kafka...");
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka is null, skipping shutdown.");
        }
    }
}
If @Component alone doesn’t work, you might need to use:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
public class StepDev {
    // Same autowiring and destroy logic
}
2. Using Dependency Injection in Cucumber Hooks
Instead of relying on field injection, manually inject the bean in Cucumber hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;

@ContextConfiguration(classes = YourSpringBootApp.class)
public class TestHooks {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    public void setKafkaBroker(EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker = broker;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            System.out.println("Stopping Embedded Kafka...");
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker was null.");
        }
    }
}
3. Explicit Context Loading for Step Definitions
Ensure your step definition class has the necessary context loading for Spring beans:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = {YourSpringBootApp.class})
public class StepDefinitions {
    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka shutdown completed.");
        }
    }
}
4. Manually Fetch Bean in Cleanup
If autowiring isn't working, you can manually retrieve the bean from the application context:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

@PreDestroy
public void shutdownKafka() {
    EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker = context.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
    if (broker != null) {
        broker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed manually.");
    }
}
5. Verify Bean Presence with Debugging
You can add a debug step to check if the Kafka broker exists:

java
Copy
Edit
@Step
public void verifyKafkaBroker() {
    System.out.println("Is Kafka broker available: " + (embeddedKafkaBroker != null));
}
If it prints false, it indicates a misconfiguration in the test context.

Summary of Steps to Fix the Issue:
Ensure the step definitions are properly managed by Spring with @CucumberContextConfiguration and @SpringBootTest.
Use constructor-based injection or explicit bean retrieval rather than relying on @Autowired alone.
If the Kafka bean is null in @PreDestroy, manually call the shutdown in Cucumber @AfterAll hooks.
Debug the test context to ensure EmbeddedKafkaBroker is being registered correctly.
If you continue to face the issue, you might need to analyze the application context loading by printing all available beans to confirm if Kafka is being instantiated in the right context.

You said:
I already have a CucumberContext file called CucumberIntegration. In that, the application comes in a method annotated with BeforeAll, but it never comes to AfterAll. I'm not sure why.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your Cucumber integration class (CucumberIntegration) has a method annotated with @BeforeAll that executes successfully but the method annotated with @AfterAll is not being invoked, here are possible reasons and solutions to address the issue.

1. Ensure Proper Cucumber Hook Usage
Cucumber's lifecycle hooks must be placed in the correct context. If @AfterAll is not being triggered, verify the following:

Correct Hook Placement Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberIntegration {

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setup() {
        System.out.println("Cucumber BeforeAll - Setup phase.");
        // Your setup code here
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void teardown() {
        System.out.println("Cucumber AfterAll - Teardown phase.");
        // Your cleanup code here
    }
}
Key Checks:

Ensure the method is public static as required by Cucumber.
Confirm that @AfterAll is imported from io.cucumber.java.AfterAll and not from JUnit.
Print debug messages to confirm whether the method gets triggered.
2. Use Cucumber Hooks in a Separate Class
Cucumber might not recognize hooks if they are placed in the main configuration class. Move them to a dedicated test hooks class:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestHooks {

    @BeforeAll
    public static void beforeAllTests() {
        System.out.println("Executing BeforeAll in TestHooks");
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void afterAllTests() {
        System.out.println("Executing AfterAll in TestHooks");
    }
}
Ensure Cucumber scans the hooks by placing them under the correct package structure.

3. Cucumber Plugin Configuration
If Cucumber is not configured to call @AfterAll, check if it is using the correct glue package in @CucumberOptions:

Example CucumberTest class:

java
Copy
Edit
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "classpath:features",
    glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions", // Make sure it includes hooks package
    plugin = {"pretty"}
)
public class CucumberTestRunner {
}
Make sure the glue package includes your hook definitions.

4. Cucumber Execution Mode (Parallel Execution)
If tests are running in parallel, some lifecycle methods (like @AfterAll) may not get executed as expected. Check if parallel execution is enabled and consider disabling it for debugging:

properties
Copy
Edit
cucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=false
5. Spring Context Interference
If the application context is shutting down unexpectedly or gets dirtied, @AfterAll might not get executed. Try forcing context shutdown within tests using:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public void cleanUp() {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
    }
}
6. JUnit vs Cucumber Conflicts
If you're using JUnit 5 (Jupiter), Cucumber 6+ might require additional integration. If JUnit's @AfterAll annotation is mistakenly used instead of Cucumber’s, it might not run:

Ensure no conflicting @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) annotations exist.
Use only one testing framework in the runner (either JUnit or Cucumber natively).
7. Try Running Cucumber Tests Explicitly
Sometimes, test execution order might prevent the shutdown from happening correctly. Try running Cucumber tests separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@myTag"
8. Debugging Steps
To further diagnose why @AfterAll is not running, you can:

Add System.exit(0); at the end of the test execution to force JVM termination and observe the teardown behavior.
Add logging inside the teardown method and analyze logs.
Check if any exceptions are preventing the normal flow of execution.
Summary of Next Steps
Ensure @AfterAll is used from io.cucumber.java.AfterAll.
Place hooks in a separate class and verify correct glue package configuration.
Debug with logging to confirm execution.
Ensure parallel execution is not interfering.
Check if the application context is shutting down prematurely.
If none of these work, sharing logs or additional test configuration details could help further diagnose the issue.

You said:
But is it the right place to destroy an embedded Kafka bean? Instead of that, I can basically just destroy every bean which is related to embedded Kafka.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right—manually destroying all beans related to Embedded Kafka instead of relying solely on Cucumber's @AfterAll may be a more reliable and controlled approach.

Best Approach to Destroy Embedded Kafka Beans:
Instead of relying on Cucumber hooks, the proper place to handle cleanup is within Spring's lifecycle management features. Here are the recommended strategies:

1. Use Spring's @PreDestroy in a Dedicated Configuration Class
Spring provides a lifecycle hook via @PreDestroy that can ensure cleanup before the context shuts down. This is a good way to destroy all Embedded Kafka-related beans safely.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.apache.kafka.common.utils.Utils;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

@Component
public class KafkaCleanupService {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroyKafkaBeans() {
        System.out.println("Destroying Embedded Kafka-related beans...");

        // Destroy Embedded Kafka Broker
        try {
            EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker = applicationContext.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
            if (broker != null) {
                broker.destroy();
                System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker was not found in context.");
        }

        // Destroy other Kafka-related beans if needed
        String[] kafkaBeans = applicationContext.getBeanNamesForType(Object.class);
        for (String beanName : kafkaBeans) {
            if (beanName.toLowerCase().contains("kafka")) {
                applicationContext.getBeanFactory().destroySingleton(beanName);
                System.out.println("Destroyed Kafka-related bean: " + beanName);
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
This method runs automatically before the Spring application context shuts down.
It explicitly looks for EmbeddedKafkaBroker and any other Kafka-related beans.
It ensures proper cleanup of all Kafka components.
2. Manually Destroy Kafka Beans in Cucumber Hooks
If you prefer doing it within Cucumber, you can manually destroy all Kafka-related beans in an @AfterAll hook, but you need to ensure proper access to the Spring context.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Component
public class CucumberKafkaTeardown {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @AfterAll
    public static void teardownKafka() {
        EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker = applicationContext.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
        if (broker != null) {
            broker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka shutdown in Cucumber @AfterAll.");
        }

        // Destroy other Kafka-related beans
        for (String beanName : applicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
            if (beanName.contains("kafka")) {
                applicationContext.getBeanFactory().destroySingleton(beanName);
                System.out.println("Destroyed Kafka-related bean: " + beanName);
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
Uses @AfterAll to destroy Kafka beans after tests.
Checks and cleans up all Kafka-related beans by name.
Potential Issues:

If the @AfterAll hook is skipped due to test failures or abrupt exits, cleanup might not happen.
Ensure that the context is shared properly between Cucumber and Spring.
3. Using @DirtiesContext for Automatic Cleanup
If Embedded Kafka is only needed for test purposes, another way to ensure it gets destroyed is by forcing a Spring context refresh after tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class SomeTestClass {
    // Test code here
}
This will reset the context after the test class execution, ensuring all beans (including Kafka-related ones) are disposed of properly.

4. Explicit Cleanup in Test Methods
If you want finer control within each test class, consider an explicit shutdown call in the test teardown phase.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterEach
public void cleanup() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka destroyed in @AfterEach.");
    }
}
5. Verifying Shutdown of Kafka Broker
To confirm if Kafka broker has been shut down, monitor the ports it was using:

java
Copy
Edit
if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
    System.out.println("Kafka Broker is running on: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
} else {
    System.out.println("Kafka broker is null, already shutdown.");
}
Recommended Approach
Use @PreDestroy inside a dedicated Spring-managed component to ensure Kafka beans are destroyed when the context shuts down.
If you prefer to handle cleanup inside tests, use Cucumber @AfterAll with access to the Spring context.
For automatic cleanup without manual handling, leverage @DirtiesContext after test execution.
Let me know if you need help with a specific approach implementation or troubleshooting further.

Visualize a scenario where Cucumber integration is being used with Spring. And there is a stepped-up file. And inside the Cucumber integration, I am using an at-the-rate embedded Kafka.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
When integrating Cucumber with Spring and utilizing the @EmbeddedKafka annotation for testing, it's crucial to ensure that the embedded Kafka broker is properly cleaned up after all tests to prevent resource leaks and potential test interference. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Utilize @DirtiesContext Annotation
The @DirtiesContext annotation informs the testing framework that the Spring application context has been modified and should be closed and removed after the test. This is particularly useful when using embedded servers like Kafka.

Implementation:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.test.annotation.DirtiesContext;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.context.EmbeddedKafka;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = { "test-topic" })
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
    // Your test cases
}
Explanation:

@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS) ensures that the application context, including the embedded Kafka broker, is cleaned up after all tests in the class have been executed.
Note: If @DirtiesContext doesn't seem to work as expected, ensure that there are no other configurations or annotations that might override its behavior. Additionally, verify that your testing framework supports this annotation.

2. Implement a Custom Shutdown Hook
If @DirtiesContext is insufficient, you can implement a custom shutdown mechanism to ensure the embedded Kafka broker is properly terminated after all tests.

Implementation:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

@Component
public class EmbeddedKafkaShutdownHook {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownEmbeddedKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker has been destroyed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The @PreDestroy annotation ensures that the shutdownEmbeddedKafka method is called before the application context is closed, allowing for graceful shutdown of the embedded Kafka broker.
3. Ensure Proper Configuration of Step Definitions
When using Cucumber with Spring, it's essential to configure your step definitions correctly to integrate with the Spring context.

Implementation:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.spring.CucumberContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@ContextConfiguration(classes = { YourSpringConfiguration.class })
public class CucumberStepDefinitions {
    // Your step definitions
}
Explanation:

@CucumberContextConfiguration and @SpringBootTest ensure that Cucumber step definitions are aware of the Spring context, allowing for proper dependency injection and context management.
4. Alternative: Use Testcontainers for Kafka
If managing the lifecycle of the embedded Kafka broker becomes cumbersome, consider using Testcontainers for Kafka. Testcontainers allows for more fine-grained control over the lifecycle of Kafka instances in tests.

Implementation:

java
Copy

This all looks like a hack. Is there a proper way of using Embedded Kafka with Cucumber, Spring Boot? And why is it not working with specifically ReactiveContext? Or maybe ReactiveContext is trying to bring up the application context.
ChatGPT said:

Integrating Embedded Kafka with Cucumber in a Spring Boot application, especially within a reactive context, requires careful configuration to ensure proper startup and cleanup of resources. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

1. Ensure Proper Integration of Cucumber with Spring Boot
To facilitate seamless integration between Cucumber and Spring Boot, particularly in a reactive environment, it's essential to configure your test setup correctly.

Implementation Steps:

Create a Cucumber Test Runner:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/features", glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions")
public class CucumberTestRunner {
    // This class will be empty; its purpose is to serve as an entry point for Cucumber tests
}
Configure Cucumber to Use Spring Context:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.spring.CucumberContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class CucumberSpringConfiguration {
    // This class ensures that Cucumber uses the Spring application context
}
Explanation:

The @CucumberContextConfiguration annotation bridges Cucumber's context with Spring's application context, ensuring that your step definitions can leverage Spring's dependency injection.

The @SpringBootTest annotation initializes the full application context, which is crucial for reactive applications to function correctly during tests.

2. Configure Embedded Kafka for Reactive Context
When working within a reactive context, it's important to ensure that the Embedded Kafka broker is configured to operate non-blocking operations.

Implementation Steps:

Add the spring-kafka-test Dependency:

Ensure your pom.xml includes:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Annotate Your Test Class with @EmbeddedKafka:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.kafka.test.context.EmbeddedKafka;
import org.springframework.test.annotation.DirtiesContext;

@DirtiesContext
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = { "test-topic" })
public class ReactiveKafkaIntegrationTest {
    // Your test cases
}
Explanation:

The @EmbeddedKafka annotation starts an embedded Kafka broker for the duration of the test, allowing your reactive components to interact with Kafka as they would in a production environment.

The @DirtiesContext annotation ensures that the application context, including the embedded Kafka broker, is cleaned up after the test, preventing potential interference with other tests.

3. Implement Proper Cleanup of Embedded Kafka
To ensure that the embedded Kafka broker is properly shut down after all Cucumber tests, especially in a reactive context, you can implement a custom shutdown mechanism.

Implementation Steps:

Create a Shutdown Hook Component:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

@Component
public class EmbeddedKafkaShutdownHook {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownEmbeddedKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker has been destroyed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The @Component annotation registers this class as a Spring-managed bean, ensuring that it participates in the application's lifecycle.

The @PreDestroy annotation marks the shutdownEmbeddedKafka method to be called before the application context is closed, allowing for graceful shutdown of the embedded Kafka broker.

4. Addressing Potential Issues in Reactive Contexts
Reactive applications are designed to be non-blocking and asynchronous. Introducing components that perform blocking operations can lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that all interactions with the embedded Kafka broker are non-blocking. If you encounter issues, consider the following:

Use Non-Blocking Kafka Clients:

Ensure that your Kafka producer and consumer configurations are set up to handle non-blocking operations, aligning with the reactive paradigm.

Monitor Application Context Initialization:

Reactive contexts can sometimes delay the initialization of certain beans. Ensure that the embedded Kafka broker is fully initialized before running your tests. You can achieve this by adding appropriate synchronization mechanisms or leveraging Spring's application events to trigger test execution after the context is fully initialized.

Conclusion:

By following these structured steps, you can effectively integrate Embedded Kafka with Cucumber in a Spring Boot application, ensuring proper startup and cleanup of resources within a reactive context. This approach minimizes potential issues and aligns with best practices for testing reactive applications.


Sources
You said:
The problem here is even if I shut down the test producer, test consumer, and Embed Kafka, the application also brings up the consumer and producer. And this will have their own issues because even if Kafka is shut down, the consumer and producer might still try to connect to it for some time. Will this cause an issue?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, if your application brings up its own consumer and producer instances while the tests also initialize their versions, this can create conflicts and unexpected behavior, especially in a reactive context where non-blocking operations keep trying to reconnect even after Embedded Kafka has been shut down.

Potential Issues
Delayed Consumer/Producer Cleanup:

When Embedded Kafka is shut down, application-level consumers and producers may still be running and attempting to reconnect.
This can result in connection errors or resource leaks that can affect subsequent tests.
Race Conditions During Shutdown:

If Kafka shuts down before the consumers/producers are fully terminated, they might enter retry loops, consuming system resources.
Test Flakiness:

If the application’s consumers/producers continue running, they may not handle test-specific conditions correctly (e.g., consuming messages that belong to different test cases).
Solutions to Avoid These Issues
1. Use Spring Profiles to Isolate Test Context
A clean way to separate test vs. production configurations is to leverage Spring profiles.

Solution:

Define a test profile in application-test.yml to disable the real consumer/producer during tests.
yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      enabled: false  # Custom flag to disable consumers
    producer:
      enabled: false  # Custom flag to disable producers
In Test Classes:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = { "test-topic" })
public class CucumberKafkaTest {
}
In Consumer Configuration: Modify your consumer beans to check for the enabled flag.

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class KafkaConsumerConfig {
    
    @Value("${spring.kafka.consumer.enabled:true}")
    private boolean kafkaConsumerEnabled;

    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory() {
        if (!kafkaConsumerEnabled) {
            return null; // Disable consumer in test profile
        }
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(/* Configs */);
    }
}
2. Manually Stop the Application’s Consumers/Producers in Tests
You can programmatically shut down consumers and producers in your test teardown logic.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

@AfterAll
public void stopKafkaClients() {
    applicationContext.getBeansOfType(KafkaProducer.class)
                      .forEach((name, bean) -> bean.close());
    
    applicationContext.getBeansOfType(KafkaConsumer.class)
                      .forEach((name, bean) -> bean.wakeup());

    System.out.println("Stopped all Kafka consumers and producers.");
}
Explanation:

This approach fetches all producer/consumer beans and gracefully stops them after tests.
wakeup() allows consumers to exit without blocking indefinitely.
3. Mock Kafka Components During Tests
Instead of running real consumers/producers during tests, you can mock them using @MockBean.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@EmbeddedKafka
public class CucumberKafkaTest {

    @MockBean
    private MyKafkaProducer myKafkaProducer;

    @MockBean
    private MyKafkaConsumer myKafkaConsumer;

    @Test
    public void testKafkaFunctionality() {
        // The real producer/consumer won't interfere with tests
    }
}
4. Use Lifecycle Hooks for Proper Shutdown Handling
Implement a proper lifecycle method to wait for consumers and producers to finish processing before shutting down Kafka.

Example in Test Hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

public class CucumberTestHooks {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @AfterAll
    public static void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Waiting for consumers to finish...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000); // Grace period for consumers to exit
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka shutdown completed.");
    }
}
5. Configure Consumer/Producer to Handle Shutdown Gracefully
Ensure your application consumers/producers can detect shutdown signals and exit cleanly.

Example Using @EventListener:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class KafkaLifecycleManager {

    private final KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer;

    public KafkaLifecycleManager(KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer) {
        this.consumer = consumer;
    }

    @EventListener(ApplicationStoppedEvent.class)
    public void onShutdown() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down Kafka consumer...");
        consumer.wakeup();
    }
}
Conclusion
The best way to handle cleanup without interference is to:

Use Spring Profiles to disable real consumers/producers during tests.
Manually stop consumers/producers after the tests using Spring’s application context.
Mock Kafka components in tests to avoid unwanted interference.
Implement lifecycle management to ensure consumers exit gracefully before Embedded Kafka is destroyed.
By adopting a combination of these approaches, you can ensure a smooth testing experience without conflicts between the test and application environments.

You said:
No, but the application works like that. So the test comes up using a step test cucumber feature. And it loads trades and basically puts it on an incoming topic. The application has its own consumers which actually consume from this topic. And then process and then produce on the outbound topic. The test consumer consumes from this particular outbound topic and then validates. So consumer has valid reason to bring its own consumer and producer.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Given your application's architecture, where the test produces data to an incoming Kafka topic, the application's consumers process it and produce to an outbound topic for validation, the challenge lies in ensuring proper startup, shutdown, and synchronization of Kafka components to avoid race conditions or failures due to lingering connections.

Key Considerations
Synchronization Between Test and Application Lifecycle:

Ensure the application consumers are fully initialized before producing test data.
Ensure that test consumers do not start consuming before the application completes processing.
Graceful Shutdown of Kafka Components:

Proper cleanup of both test and application consumers/producers after tests.
Avoiding residual Kafka connections that might cause issues in subsequent tests.
Recommended Approach
1. Use Cucumber Hooks for Controlled Start and Cleanup
Implementation in Step Definitions:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.kafka.listener.KafkaMessageListenerContainer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaMessageListenerContainer<String, String> testConsumerContainer;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUpKafka() {
        System.out.println("Starting Embedded Kafka...");
        // Ensure Kafka is up and running before producing test data
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDownKafka() {
        System.out.println("Stopping Kafka components...");
        try {
            testConsumerContainer.stop();
            kafkaTemplate.destroy();
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Kafka components shutdown successfully.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error shutting down Kafka: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

@BeforeAll ensures test setup is ready before producing data.
@AfterAll gracefully stops all Kafka components (consumer, producer, broker).
KafkaTemplate.destroy() ensures proper producer cleanup.
testConsumerContainer.stop() stops the test consumer gracefully.
2. Control Consumer Start-up in Tests
Instead of relying on auto-started consumers, manually start them when required to ensure proper sequence:

java
Copy
Edit
@Test
public void testProcessingFlow() {
    testConsumerContainer.start();
    kafkaTemplate.send("incoming-topic", "test-message");

    // Await processing and validation
    ConsumerRecord<String, String> record = testConsumer.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
    assertNotNull(record);
    assertEquals("expected-output", record.value());
}
3. Spring Profile Isolation for Test Configurations
Create a test profile to tweak Kafka configurations for tests:

application-test.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      group-id: test-consumer-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
    producer:
      retries: 3
    listener:
      ack-mode: manual
Use in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = {"incoming-topic", "outgoing-topic"})
public class CucumberKafkaTest {
}
Explanation:

Ensures the test consumer starts consuming messages from the beginning (auto-offset-reset: earliest).
Allows the test profile to override production Kafka settings.
4. Ensure Sequential Processing with Latch Mechanism
Use a CountDownLatch to synchronize test production and consumption, ensuring messages are processed in order:

java
Copy
Edit
private final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

@KafkaListener(topics = "outgoing-topic", groupId = "test-group")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    latch.countDown();
}

@Test
public void testProcessing() throws InterruptedException {
    kafkaTemplate.send("incoming-topic", "test-message");

    boolean completed = latch.await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    assertTrue(completed, "Message processing did not complete in time.");
}
Explanation:

Ensures tests wait until message processing completes.
Prevents test failure due to asynchronous processing delays.
5. Parallel Test Execution Management
Since your application handles real consumers, if tests run in parallel, they might interfere with each other. Consider:

Running tests sequentially using:
shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1
Using unique Kafka group IDs for tests to avoid conflicts:
yaml
Copy
Edit
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id: test-group-${random.uuid}
6. Handling Consumer Cleanup Delays
Kafka consumers have a rebalance delay that might affect cleanup. Set a shorter session timeout to ensure faster consumer cleanup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    consumer:
      session-timeout-ms: 10000
Summary of Best Practices
Control startup/shutdown using Cucumber hooks (@BeforeAll/@AfterAll).
Manually start test consumers to synchronize processing.
Use Spring profiles to isolate test configurations.
Leverage CountDownLatch to ensure ordered execution.
Manage parallel tests with unique group IDs and sequential execution.
Tune consumer settings to handle shutdown properly.
By implementing these strategies, you can achieve reliable and efficient testing without conflicts between application and test consumers. Let me know if you'd like a specific implementation example or further clarification.

You said:
No. So, the applications consumer and producer come up when the application start event is done. So basically they are up. Now the test starts running. When the test starts running, the test consumer and producers come up. They do their job, basically. So the producer produces on the inbound topic and then the applications consumer consumes it, processes and then produces it on the outbound. The test consumer then consumes it from there and validates. So this is how it works. So, your assumption that you need to do something on the main application consumer-producer doesn't look correct.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Thanks for the clarification. Given your application's flow where the application's consumers and producers come up automatically after the application start event, and the Cucumber test brings up its own consumers and producers for validation, the focus should primarily be on:

Test Resource Cleanup
Ensuring that the test consumers and producers, along with the Embedded Kafka instance, are properly shut down after the tests are complete.

Avoiding Resource Conflicts
Making sure that test and application consumers/producers do not interfere with each other or leave lingering connections.

Recommended Approach for Cleanup
1. Using Cucumber Hooks for Cleanup
Since the application consumers/producers are not within the test’s control, the test should focus on cleaning up its own resources properly.

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.kafka.listener.KafkaMessageListenerContainer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CucumberKafkaTestLifecycle {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> testKafkaTemplate;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaMessageListenerContainer<String, String> testConsumerContainer;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void startTestKafka() {
        System.out.println("Starting Embedded Kafka for test...");
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void stopTestKafka() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Stopping test consumers and producers...");
            testConsumerContainer.stop();
            testKafkaTemplate.destroy();

            System.out.println("Shutting down Embedded Kafka...");
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error during Kafka shutdown: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
Why This Works:

Ensures that only the test-related Kafka components are shut down after the tests.
The main application consumers/producers continue running and are unaffected.
2. Ensuring Test Isolation via Separate Kafka Topics
To prevent accidental interference with the main application, ensure the test topics are prefixed/suffixed appropriately:

java
Copy
Edit
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = {"test-inbound-topic", "test-outbound-topic"})
In the test profile:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      group-id: test-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
This way, tests will always consume/produce from dedicated topics, ensuring isolation from the application.

3. Controlling Test Execution Timing
Since the application consumers/producers start independently, it's important to synchronize the test execution:

java
Copy
Edit
@Test
public void testMessageFlow() throws InterruptedException {
    System.out.println("Starting test...");

    // Produce test data to inbound topic
    kafkaTemplate.send("test-inbound-topic", "key", "test-message");

    // Allow some time for the application's consumer to process
    Thread.sleep(5000);

    // Validate the processed message on the outbound topic
    ConsumerRecord<String, String> record = testConsumer.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
    assertNotNull(record);
    assertEquals("expected-output", record.value());
}
This ensures:

Messages have enough time to be processed by the application.
The test consumer does not start consuming too early.
4. Avoiding Port Conflicts and Cleanup Delays
When the test producer and consumer are destroyed, they may still try reconnecting for some time. To minimize the impact, consider:

Shortening session-timeout in test properties:
yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    consumer:
      session-timeout-ms: 5000
Using Kafka health checks before shutting down:
java
Copy
Edit
while (!embeddedKafkaBroker.getKafkaServers().isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("Waiting for Kafka to terminate...");
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
5. Running Tests in Isolation
If the tests are being run in parallel with the application in the same environment, consider:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
This ensures each test run has its own isolated environment.

Conclusion
No Need to Modify Application Consumers/Producers:

Focus only on the test consumers/producers and Embedded Kafka.
Use Proper Cleanup in @AfterAll:

Stop the test consumers, producers, and Embedded Kafka broker properly.
Ensure Topic Isolation:

Use dedicated topics for tests to avoid interference.
Control Test Timing:

Ensure application consumers have enough time to process before validation.
Optimize Resource Cleanup:

Adjust Kafka configurations for faster test completion.
By following these approaches, you can achieve a smooth test workflow without impacting the main application consumers and producers. Let me know if you need further clarification or a refined implementation.

You said:
Even then, if the controller tests are throwing application threshold 1 issue, are they trying to bring their own application context and they are finding that there is already an application context up and showing that exception?Even then, if the controller tests are throwing application threshold 1 issue, are they trying to bring their own application context and they are finding that there is already an application context up and showing that exception?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, if your controller tests are throwing an "application threshold 1" issue, it likely indicates that the tests are trying to create their own Spring application context, but an existing context is already running. This can happen due to the following reasons:

Potential Causes of the Issue
Multiple Application Contexts Are Being Created:

Your controller tests and Cucumber tests might be initializing separate Spring contexts, leading to conflicts.
Spring Boot attempts to manage a single context, and if it detects an existing context, it may throw an error when a new one is requested.
Test Execution Order:

If controller tests are executed after Cucumber tests (or vice versa), and the previous context is still active, it may lead to resource threshold issues.
Context Caching Conflicts:

Spring reuses the application context by default across tests, but the introduction of Embedded Kafka or other configurations might force new context creation.
Incorrect Test Annotations:

Use of @SpringBootTest in both Cucumber and controller tests could be causing redundant context loads.
Solutions to Fix the Issue
1. Use @DirtiesContext to Reset Context Between Tests
To ensure the application context is properly reset after each test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
    // Your test code here
}
Explanation:

This will force the context to be closed and recreated after each test class execution, preventing context conflicts.
2. Use Separate Test Configurations
Create a separate configuration for Cucumber and controller tests to avoid interference.

Example:
Define test configurations separately.

java
Copy
Edit
// For Cucumber Tests
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = CucumberTestConfig.class)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
java
Copy
Edit
// For Controller Tests
@SpringBootTest(classes = ControllerTestConfig.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
Define the configuration classes explicitly to load only the required beans:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class CucumberTestConfig {
    // Cucumber-specific beans and configurations
}

@Configuration
public class ControllerTestConfig {
    // Controller test-specific beans and configurations
}
3. Use @SpringBootTest with webEnvironment for Isolation
By specifying the web environment, you can avoid conflicts related to context reuse:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ControllerTest {
}
Explanation:

The RANDOM_PORT environment helps ensure tests do not conflict with a running instance.
4. Run Tests in Separate JVM Instances
If conflicts persist, running tests in separate JVMs can help:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
Explanation:

This forces Maven to run tests in isolated environments, ensuring no shared context.
5. Use ContextHierarchy to Manage Context Layers
If your tests need different levels of application context, consider using:

java
Copy
Edit
@ContextHierarchy({
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = {ParentConfig.class}),
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = {ChildConfig.class})
})
public class ContextHierarchyTest {
}
Explanation:

This allows better context management by defining hierarchical context dependencies.
6. Check for Context-Loading Conflicts in Logs
Enable debug logs for the test execution to identify where multiple contexts are being created:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Look for log entries related to context loading:

yaml
Copy
Edit
o.s.b.t.context.SpringBootTestContextBootstrapper : Found multiple application contexts
7. Explicitly Shut Down the Spring Context in Tests
To ensure the previous context is fully closed before running new tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void closeContext() {
    context.close();
}
Recommended Approach
Ensure Isolation: Use different configurations for Cucumber and controller tests.
Control Context Lifecycle: Use @DirtiesContext to avoid reusing context across test suites.
Run Tests Separately: Consider running controller and Cucumber tests independently.
Review Logs: Check for duplicate context loading messages and address accordingly.
If you provide more details about the exact exception message, I can give a more precise solution tailored to your setup.

You said:
Are we sure that Cucumber integration loads a new context and destroys that context afterwards? Because without Embed Kafka, everything was working fine, the controller test and Cucumber test.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, typically Cucumber with Spring Boot loads a new context per test run unless explicitly configured otherwise. However, the introduction of Embedded Kafka might be altering the context behavior, leading to the observed issues.

Why Everything Worked Without Embedded Kafka?
Context Sharing Behavior:

Spring Boot tests generally reuse the application context across test classes to speed up execution.
Without Embedded Kafka, the same context might have been shared between Cucumber and controller tests without issue.
Embedded Kafka Impact:

Adding @EmbeddedKafka might have introduced additional beans (e.g., Kafka brokers, producers, consumers) that require a fresh context, potentially leading to conflicts.
Embedded Kafka can override default settings and force new context loads due to its underlying dependencies.
Does Cucumber Load a New Context by Default?
By default, Cucumber will reuse the Spring context unless explicitly configured to refresh or destroy it.

How Cucumber Works with Spring:
When using @CucumberContextConfiguration, Cucumber loads the Spring context once per test run and reuses it across scenarios.
The context is only refreshed or destroyed if:
The @DirtiesContext annotation is used.
Spring detects changes that require a new context.
Manual shutdown is invoked.
Confirming Context Behavior
You can check whether Cucumber is creating multiple contexts by adding logging:

Enable Spring Context Debugging:

Add this to application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Look for logs such as:

yaml
Copy
Edit
o.s.b.t.context.SpringBootTestContextBootstrapper : Found existing application context
If this message appears, the same context is reused.

Potential Reasons for Context Issues with Embedded Kafka
Embedded Kafka Requires a New Context:

Spring may create a fresh context due to changes introduced by @EmbeddedKafka, leading to conflicts when controller tests expect the previous context.
Kafka Beans Not Properly Destroyed:

Even if Cucumber shuts down, Kafka-related beans may linger and cause conflicts when the controller tests attempt to initialize.
Context Caching Conflict:

If @SpringBootTest in controller tests relies on the cached context, Embedded Kafka may prevent proper reuse.
Solutions to Ensure Proper Context Handling
1. Use @DirtiesContext Explicitly
To ensure Cucumber test context is cleaned up after execution:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
This ensures that the Cucumber context is destroyed after tests, preventing conflicts with controller tests.

2. Use Isolated Test Configurations
Define different configurations for Cucumber and controller tests to avoid overlapping dependencies:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = CucumberTestConfig.class)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = ControllerTestConfig.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
3. Disable Context Caching in Tests
If context sharing is causing issues, disable it in your test suite:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@TestPropertySource(properties = "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true")
public class ControllerTest {
}
4. Manually Destroy Kafka Beans After Cucumber Tests
Add an explicit cleanup mechanism to ensure Kafka is fully terminated:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanUp() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
}
5. Run Tests Separately to Identify Conflicts
Run controller and Cucumber tests independently to confirm whether the issue is context-related:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=ControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberIntegrationTest
If they pass separately but fail together, it confirms context overlap.

Recommended Approach
Verify Context Sharing Behavior:

Add debug logging to check whether contexts are being shared or refreshed.
Use @DirtiesContext:

Force cleanup after tests to avoid conflicts.
Manually Cleanup Kafka Beans:

Ensure Embedded Kafka resources are released.
Profile-Based Isolation:

Use separate profiles for tests to minimize dependency conflicts.
Let me know if you'd like to explore further based on your findings from logging or test isolation runs.

You said:
After adding Dirty's context, it started throwing weird issues. I was getting no context, no context messages for all the tests.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If adding @DirtiesContext is causing issues such as "no context available" errors, it likely indicates that the test framework is attempting to reuse a context that has been invalidated. This suggests that the tests rely on context caching and expect it to persist across different test classes. Since @DirtiesContext forces a full teardown and recreation of the context, subsequent tests might be running before the new context is fully initialized, leading to failures.

Why This Happens
Context Destruction Mid-Execution:

@DirtiesContext might be tearing down the application context before other tests have completed initialization.
If a test method/class marks the context as dirty, subsequent tests might not reinitialize it properly.
Spring Context Cache Invalidation:

Spring Boot caches application contexts by default across test classes. Adding @DirtiesContext can clear the cache unexpectedly, leading to test failures.
Test Order Execution Conflicts:

If controller and Cucumber tests depend on the same application context but have different test runners, their execution order might lead to unexpected shutdowns.
Solutions to Fix "No Context" Issues
1. Remove @DirtiesContext and Use Application Context Manually
Instead of using @DirtiesContext, manually control the application context lifecycle in tests to prevent unexpected shutdowns.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void closeContext() {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
        System.out.println("Application context closed manually.");
    }
}
2. Use Context Hierarchy to Avoid Context Conflicts
Instead of marking the entire context as dirty, split context into parent and child levels to avoid unnecessary destruction:

java
Copy
Edit
@ContextHierarchy({
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = ParentConfig.class),
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = TestConfig.class)
})
public class MultiContextTest {
}
3. Isolate Cucumber and Controller Tests Using Different Test Configurations
Ensure Cucumber and controller tests use different application configurations to avoid conflicts.

Cucumber test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = CucumberTestConfig.class)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Controller test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = ControllerTestConfig.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
4. Control Context Initialization Timing in Tests
Introduce a wait mechanism to ensure the context is fully initialized before tests start:

java
Copy
Edit
@BeforeAll
public static void waitForContextInitialization() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(3000); // Allow context to initialize properly
}
5. Use a Test Profile to Manage Context Behavior
Instead of marking the context dirty, use a separate profile for tests to isolate environments.

application-test.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      group-id: test-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
Test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
public class TestConsumer {
}
6. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Context Reinitialization Issues
If context issues persist, force sequential execution of tests to avoid overlapping context shutdown.

Run tests one by one:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=ControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberIntegrationTest
Or configure Maven Surefire:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
7. Use @SpringBootTest with Specific webEnvironment
Ensure that tests run in isolated environments by setting:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ControllerTest {
}
This prevents port conflicts and forces a new application context for each test.

8. Explicitly Shutdown Embedded Kafka After Tests
Instead of relying on Spring's lifecycle, manually stop Kafka to ensure the context is not unexpectedly affected.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanUpKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
}
Recommended Approach
Remove @DirtiesContext and manage context manually using ConfigurableApplicationContext.close().
Use separate profiles for different test types to avoid interference.
Run tests sequentially during debugging to identify potential conflicts.
Ensure proper context initialization with sleep/wait mechanisms if necessary.
Isolate test dependencies by loading only the required configurations.
Let me know if you'd like help implementing a specific approach or troubleshooting further.

You said:
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanUpKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
} looks to be the cleanest way
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your approach using @Autowired for EmbeddedKafkaBroker and cleaning it up with an @AfterAll hook is indeed a clean and efficient way to ensure proper shutdown of the Embedded Kafka instance after all tests are completed.

However, there are a couple of adjustments to make sure it works correctly within the context of static test lifecycle methods.

Correct Implementation:
Since @AfterAll requires a static method, you cannot directly autowire non-static fields. The correct way to implement this is by using a setter method or retrieving the bean from the application context.

Solution 1: Using Setter Injection to Handle Static Context

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    public void setEmbeddedKafkaBroker(EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker = broker;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void cleanUpKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No Embedded Kafka instance found.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The setter injection allows the static method to access the broker instance.
@AfterAll ensures cleanup happens only once after all tests.
The null check prevents unnecessary errors if the broker was not initialized.
Solution 2: Using Application Context to Fetch Embedded Kafka Bean

Alternatively, you can retrieve the broker from the Spring application context in the cleanup phase:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    private static ApplicationContext context;

    @Autowired
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) {
        KafkaTestLifecycle.context = applicationContext;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void cleanUpKafka() {
        EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker = context.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed successfully.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Uses ApplicationContext to retrieve the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean dynamically.
Ensures compatibility with static lifecycle methods.
Additional Best Practices:
Logging Cleanup:
Add logs to confirm Kafka shutdown for debugging.

Handling Exceptions Gracefully:
Wrap the shutdown logic in a try-catch block to prevent test failures due to unexpected shutdown issues.

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanUpKafka() {
    try {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Kafka broker shut down.");
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println("Error during Kafka shutdown: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
Summary:
Preferred Approach: Use setter injection to provide a reference to EmbeddedKafkaBroker for static cleanup.
Alternative Approach: Use ApplicationContext to dynamically fetch and destroy the bean.
Ensure Graceful Cleanup: Add logs and error handling to verify correct shutdown.
This should ensure a clean and reliable shutdown of Embedded Kafka after test execution. Let me know if you need further refinements.

You said:
ISo if we destroy the Embedded Kafka Bean, after all, can we be sure the issue will be resolved?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Destroying the Embedded Kafka bean in the @AfterAll hook is a clean approach, but whether it completely resolves the issue depends on several factors related to your test setup and how the application handles Kafka connections.

Potential Outcomes of Destroying Embedded Kafka
Expected Outcome (Issue Resolved):

If the issue is due to Embedded Kafka persisting across tests, destroying the broker will free resources and prevent lingering connections.
When the application starts, it should reconnect to a fresh Kafka instance when a new test run begins.
Potential Remaining Issues:
Even after destroying Embedded Kafka, consider the following potential pitfalls:

a) Application Consumers Still Running:

If the application consumers continue trying to poll Kafka after shutdown, they might throw errors due to missing brokers.
Solution: Ensure the consumers gracefully handle org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException.
b) Application Context Issues:

If the application context is not shut down properly, lingering Spring beans might attempt to reconnect to a non-existent Kafka.
Solution: Consider shutting down the Spring context if needed.
c) Re-initialization During Next Test Run:

Ensure the Kafka broker is properly restarted before subsequent tests start to avoid "broker not available" issues.
Solution: Add a small delay between shutdown and test restarts to allow resource cleanup.
Verification Steps: To confirm whether the issue is resolved:

Add logging inside @AfterAll and verify shutdown completion.
Run tests in isolation to confirm Embedded Kafka isn’t interfering with controller tests.
Monitor logs for exceptions related to "Kafka not available" after tests.
Recommended Steps to Confirm Fix
Implement Cleanup Properly in @AfterAll:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanUpKafka() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed.");
    }
}
Handle Consumers Gracefully in Application: Ensure your application's Kafka consumers can handle disconnections cleanly:

java
Copy
Edit
@EventListener(ApplicationStoppedEvent.class)
public void onShutdown() {
    kafkaConsumer.wakeup();  // Ensure consumer exits gracefully
    System.out.println("Application consumer shutting down.");
}
Test Execution Isolation: Run the tests independently to confirm no shared resources cause failures:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=ControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberIntegrationTest
Parallel Execution Consideration: Ensure tests are not running in parallel by adding:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Final Answer:
Yes, destroying the Embedded Kafka bean after all tests should resolve the issue, provided that:

The application handles Kafka disconnections gracefully.
No stale consumer/producer connections remain active after shutdown.
Tests do not run concurrently and interfere with each other.
If issues persist, it might indicate deeper problems such as improper context management or timing issues, which would require additional steps like adjusting test execution flow or manually restarting the application context between tests.

Let me know if you encounter any residual issues after applying the cleanup strategy.

You said:
The Maven fork solution, if I have a lot of tests, how will it handle, will it create an application context for everything in isolation? Will that not be a bad solution because it will load everything and basically the tests will become bulky?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're correct in considering the impact of using the Maven fork option (-DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false) for test isolation. While this approach can help in preventing shared state issues across tests, it comes with trade-offs, especially in terms of performance and resource utilization.

How the Maven Fork Solution Works
When you run tests with:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
Fork Count (-DforkCount=1):

This ensures that tests run in a single JVM instance, meaning no parallel execution.
However, it still leads to context re-initialization across test classes.
Reuse Forks (-DreuseForks=false):

Forces Maven to create a fresh JVM process for each test class, leading to:
Complete application context reloads for every test class.
More memory and CPU consumption.
Increased test execution time.
Potential Drawbacks of Using Forking for Isolation
Performance Overhead:

Starting a new application context for each test can be slow, especially for large Spring Boot applications.
This may lead to higher resource consumption (CPU/memory), making tests bulky and time-consuming.
Lack of Context Caching:

Spring Boot typically caches the application context to optimize test runs. With forks, caching is lost, leading to redundant initializations.
Complex Dependency Setup:

If your application has a complex dependency graph (database, caches, Kafka, etc.), initializing everything per test run can be impractical.
When Should You Use the Maven Fork Solution?
Forking is a viable solution if:

Your tests have side effects that cannot be isolated within the same context.
You are facing random failures due to shared resources (like Embedded Kafka).
Test execution time is not a major concern, and correctness is the priority.
When to Avoid Forking:
If your tests are mostly independent and can be handled using proper Spring test configuration isolation (e.g., profiles, @DirtiesContext), then avoid forking to improve test efficiency.

Better Alternatives to Forking
Instead of relying on forking, consider the following alternatives to achieve test isolation:

1. Use @DirtiesContext Selectively
Instead of applying it globally, use it only on tests that modify the context:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class TestWithDirtyContext {
}
This ensures a fresh context only where required, reducing the overhead of reloading everything.

2. Profile-Based Isolation
Use Spring profiles to load test-specific configurations, allowing the same context to be shared across tests without interference.

Example:

application-test.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      group-id: test-group
Test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class IsolatedTest {
}
This way, each test runs with isolated dependencies without restarting the entire application.

3. Use Cucumber Hooks to Manage Context
Ensure proper teardown in Cucumber test lifecycle to clean up Kafka and other resources:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void tearDown() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
}
This avoids the need for full reinitialization across test runs.

4. Grouping Tests Based on Context Requirements
Instead of forking the entire test suite, you can split tests based on the context they need:

xml
Copy
Edit
<groups>
  <run>
    <include name="controller-tests"/>
    <exclude name="integration-tests"/>
  </run>
</groups>
Run different groups with:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dgroups=controller-tests
This allows you to reuse the context within similar tests.

5. Parallel Execution Within the Same JVM
If test speed is a concern, configure Maven Surefire to run tests in parallel within the same JVM while ensuring they don't share conflicting resources:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <parallel>classes</parallel>
        <threadCount>4</threadCount>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
This speeds up execution while maintaining some level of isolation.

Conclusion
Is the Maven Fork Solution the Right Choice?

If test correctness is the primary goal, and performance is secondary, it might be a reasonable temporary fix.
If performance is critical, it's better to explore alternatives like @DirtiesContext, test profiles, and resource management.
Recommended Approach:

First, try using Spring profiles and better cleanup strategies (@AfterAll hooks).
If issues persist, selectively apply @DirtiesContext only where necessary.
Only as a last resort, consider forking but be aware of the associated resource cost.
Let me know if you need guidance on implementing one of these approaches!

Hello! How can I assist you today?

You said:
Is Embedded Kafka in any way dependent on Jakarta Validation Library?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, Embedded Kafka (provided by spring-kafka-test) is not dependent on the Jakarta Validation Library (jakarta.validation or javax.validation).

Why?
Embedded Kafka Overview:
Embedded Kafka is a lightweight, in-memory version of Apache Kafka used primarily for testing Kafka-based applications within a Spring Boot environment. It is initialized using the spring-kafka-test dependency and runs a local Kafka broker without requiring an external cluster.

Jakarta Validation Overview:
The Jakarta Validation library (formerly javax.validation) is used for bean validation in Java applications. It helps validate input data against constraints such as @NotNull, @Size, and @Pattern. It is typically used in web applications, service layers, or persistence layers with frameworks like Hibernate.

Dependency Check
If you see references to Jakarta Validation when working with Embedded Kafka, they might come from:

Transitive Dependencies:
Some dependencies in your project (e.g., Spring Boot Web, JPA) might include Jakarta Validation indirectly.

Example Transitive Dependency Tree Check (Maven):

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn dependency:tree | grep validation
Spring Boot Autoconfiguration:
If Jakarta Validation is included in your dependencies, Spring Boot might attempt to auto-configure it, leading to unexpected behavior.

Kafka Message Serialization/Deserialization:
If you are using custom Kafka serializers or deserializers that involve POJOs with validation annotations (@Valid, @NotNull), Jakarta Validation could come into play when processing records.

How to Ensure Embedded Kafka Works Without Jakarta Validation
Check Dependencies:
Review your pom.xml or build.gradle for unwanted Jakarta Validation dependencies.

Exclude Jakarta Validation if Unnecessary:
If you don't need it, exclude it from your dependencies:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>jakarta.validation</groupId>
            <artifactId>jakarta.validation-api</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
Use Minimal Dependencies for Testing:
Keep the test dependencies separate in the test scope to prevent conflicts.

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Conclusion
Embedded Kafka does not directly depend on Jakarta Validation, but Jakarta Validation might be indirectly included due to your project's dependencies. You should analyze your dependency tree and exclude Jakarta Validation if it's causing issues.

Let me know if you need further clarification or help with dependency management!

You said:
I am asking this because when I started using Embedded Kafka, the controller test stopped working or started failing. And when I put the application logs in debug, I saw a message no configuration, configuration cannot be loaded as no provider for Jakarta library, Jakarta validation field in the logs.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The message you’re seeing in the logs, stating that "configuration cannot be loaded as no provider for Jakarta validation", suggests that when you introduced Embedded Kafka, your Spring Boot application (especially in the test context) is trying to load a bean or perform some validation, but it cannot find the Jakarta Validation provider (e.g., Hibernate Validator).

Potential Causes of This Issue
Spring Boot Auto-Configuration Behavior:

When Embedded Kafka is introduced via spring-kafka-test, Spring Boot might be re-evaluating auto-configuration and trying to configure Jakarta Validation based on some component dependencies in the application context.
If spring-boot-starter-validation is not explicitly included in your dependencies, Spring may attempt to initialize it but fail, leading to this warning.
Dependency Conflict or Missing Validation Provider:

Some Spring components (like WebFlux, Spring Data, or WebMVC) might include Jakarta Validation as an optional dependency.
If a bean in your controller layer is using validation annotations such as @Valid, @NotNull, @Size, etc., Spring may try to load the Jakarta Validation provider but fail because it is missing.
Embedded Kafka Indirect Dependency on Spring Components:

When you introduce spring-kafka-test, it might bring transitive dependencies that influence bean creation, leading to validation bean scanning.
Solutions to Fix This Issue
1. Explicitly Add the Jakarta Validation API and Hibernate Validator
If your application uses validation (directly or indirectly), ensure that the required dependencies are present:

Maven:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>
Gradle:

gradle
Copy
Edit
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'
This will explicitly provide Jakarta Validation and prevent the error.

2. Disable Auto-Configuration for Jakarta Validation in Tests
If you do not need validation for tests and want to suppress the warnings, exclude the auto-configuration in your test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(
    properties = "spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.validation.ValidationAutoConfiguration"
)
public class ControllerTest {
}
This prevents Spring from loading the validation-related auto-configuration.

3. Check for Beans Requiring Validation
Check if any of your controller methods, DTOs, or service layer components use Jakarta Validation annotations like:

java
Copy
Edit
public ResponseEntity<String> processData(@Valid @RequestBody MyRequestDTO request) {
    // Processing logic
}
If such annotations are present and Jakarta Validation is not on the classpath, you should either:

Add the dependency (Solution 1).
Remove unnecessary @Valid annotations from test DTOs.
4. Isolate Test Context Using Profiles
If Embedded Kafka is affecting the test setup, create a separate test profile that excludes unnecessary components:

application-test.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.validation.ValidationAutoConfiguration
Activate this profile in your test:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
}
5. Run Dependency Analysis to Identify Conflicts
Sometimes, transitive dependencies could be bringing validation-related libraries that interfere with Embedded Kafka.

Run the following command to analyze dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn dependency:tree | grep jakarta
If you see Jakarta dependencies pulled by unexpected libraries (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web), you might need to exclude them explicitly.

6. Use Minimal Test Context Configuration
Instead of loading the full application context in tests, consider using WebFlux/WebMVC test configurations to avoid unnecessary bean loading:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebFluxTest(controllers = MyController.class)  // Use for reactive controllers
//@WebMvcTest(controllers = MyController.class) // Use for non-reactive controllers
public class MyControllerTest {
}
This loads only the controller layer, bypassing Kafka and Jakarta Validation issues.

Conclusion
If your application requires validation, explicitly add spring-boot-starter-validation to your dependencies.
If validation is not required for tests, disable it using spring.autoconfigure.exclude in test properties.
Check for unintended validation annotations in your controller DTOs that may trigger this warning.
Analyze dependency conflicts using mvn dependency:tree.
Let me know if you'd like a more specific solution based on your project's dependency setup.

You said:
Why will in test applicationcontext threshold issue come
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The "application context threshold" issue in tests usually occurs when the Spring test framework detects an excessive number of application contexts being created, leading to resource exhaustion, slow test execution, or unintended side effects. This happens primarily due to:

Potential Causes of Application Context Threshold Issues in Tests
Excessive Context Creation Due to Incorrect Test Configuration

If each test class or method initializes a new application context, it can exceed the default context threshold.
This is especially common when:
@SpringBootTest is used repeatedly without caching enabled.
Different configurations are loaded for each test, preventing context reuse.
Solution:
Use proper caching with @SpringBootTest to reuse the context across tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
public class MyControllerTest {
}
Misuse of @DirtiesContext Annotation

@DirtiesContext marks the context as dirty and forces Spring to reload it for subsequent tests.
Overuse of this annotation (e.g., applying it at the method level) can lead to multiple unnecessary context creations.
Solution:
Use @DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS) selectively at the class level to avoid excessive reloads.

Parallel Execution of Tests with Shared Contexts

Running tests in parallel (mvn surefire parallel=test) can trigger multiple application context instantiations, leading to context threshold violations.
Solution:
Run tests sequentially to prevent concurrent context creation:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Mixing Multiple Spring Test Annotations

Using conflicting test annotations like @WebMvcTest, @SpringBootTest, and @DataJpaTest across different tests can cause multiple contexts to load.
Solution:
Use test slicing where appropriate to load only the necessary part of the application:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(controllers = MyController.class)
public class MyControllerTest {
}
Embedded Kafka and Other External Resources

Introducing @EmbeddedKafka may trigger additional application context reloads, especially if used in conjunction with full @SpringBootTest without careful configuration.
Solution:
Ensure @EmbeddedKafka is used in a dedicated test configuration and does not load unnecessary beans.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = {"test-topic"})
public class KafkaTest {
}
Context Caching Disabled or Ineffective

Spring caches application contexts by default to optimize test execution. However, it might not work correctly if:
Different test configurations are used.
Tests override properties causing context cache invalidation.
Solution:
Ensure that test classes reuse context with consistent configurations.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true")
public class MyTest {
}
Manual Application Context Creation in Tests

If tests manually create application contexts using new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(), it can quickly reach the threshold.
Solution:
Avoid manual instantiation and rely on Spring-managed lifecycle.

Context Not Being Properly Destroyed After Tests

If your tests create contexts that are not properly destroyed, the application may hit the limit of open contexts.
Solution:
Close the context manually in @AfterAll hooks if necessary:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public void tearDown() {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
    }
}
How to Debug and Resolve Context Threshold Issues
Check Logs for Context Initialization Messages:
Enable debug logging to track context creation:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Look for logs like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
o.s.boot.SpringApplication : Starting application in context
Review Test Execution Order:
Run tests individually to isolate which test triggers the issue:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=SpecificTest
Dependency Analysis:
Ensure no test dependencies conflict by running:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn dependency:tree
Optimize Test Scope:
Use focused tests that load only necessary parts of the application.

Conclusion
To fix the application context threshold issue:

Optimize Context Reuse: Ensure tests share contexts where possible using @SpringBootTest efficiently.
Reduce Overuse of @DirtiesContext: Use it sparingly to avoid unnecessary reloads.
Avoid Parallel Test Execution: Run tests sequentially when necessary.
Close Contexts Properly: Ensure resources are cleaned up to avoid exceeding thresholds.
Limit Test Scope: Use test slices like @WebMvcTest or @DataJpaTest to load only required beans.
If you're still facing issues, let me know, and we can dive into specific test configurations or logs to diagnose further.

You said:
No, threshold(1) is the error
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're encountering an "ApplicationContext threshold(1)" error in your tests, it usually indicates that the Spring Boot application context is already initialized, and a second attempt to initialize another context is conflicting with the first.

Possible Causes of the threshold(1) Error
Multiple Test Contexts Trying to Load Simultaneously

If tests attempt to start multiple instances of the Spring application context, it can exceed the limit of one context that some environments (e.g., reactive web contexts) enforce.
This typically happens when:
Tests are not sharing the same context.
The test setup is forcing the creation of a new application instance.
Embedded Kafka Forcing a New Context

When using @EmbeddedKafka, it might cause an unintended new application context to be initialized, conflicting with an already-running instance.
Context Being Reinitialized by Different Test Annotations

Using @SpringBootTest in multiple test classes could lead to multiple application context initializations.
Having different configurations across test classes forces context recreation instead of reuse.
Parallel Test Execution

If tests run in parallel (mvn surefire/failsafe parallel=test), and an application context has already been initialized, additional instances can hit the context limit.
Reactive Application Behavior

In a reactive context, such as with WebFlux, a single application context might be expected. Additional instantiations could trigger a threshold(1) violation.
Solutions to Fix the threshold(1) Error
1. Ensure Tests Reuse the Same Context
To avoid redundant context loads, use the following approach:

Add @TestInstance to Reuse the Same Instance Per Class

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
public class MyTest {
}
This ensures that the context is not reloaded for each test method.

Check If @DirtiesContext Is Being Overused

Ensure @DirtiesContext is not used in multiple places unless absolutely necessary.
2. Limit Context Creation Using Profiles
If Embedded Kafka or other components are forcing context recreation, create a dedicated test profile to isolate dependencies.

Example: application-test.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
  main:
    allow-bean-definition-overriding: true
In test classes:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
public class MyKafkaTest {
}
This way, test-specific components won’t interfere with production-like settings.

3. Use @ContextHierarchy for Better Context Management
If different parts of the application require different configurations, use @ContextHierarchy to manage them efficiently.

java
Copy
Edit
@ContextHierarchy({
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = ParentConfig.class),
    @ContextConfiguration(classes = ChildConfig.class)
})
public class ContextHierarchyTest {
}
This avoids the creation of unnecessary parent contexts.

4. Check Test Annotations and Use Context Caching
Ensure you're not mixing test annotations that might force new context initialization:

If you're using @WebMvcTest or @WebFluxTest alongside @SpringBootTest, prefer using test slices to minimize context loading.
Example for reactive controllers:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebFluxTest(controllers = MyReactiveController.class)
public class MyControllerTest {
}
5. Manually Shut Down Context Before Reloading
If a test requires reinitializing the context, ensure the previous context is closed properly to avoid threshold errors.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void closeContext() {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
    }
}
6. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Race Conditions
If tests are running in parallel, limit them to a single thread to avoid exceeding the threshold.

Modify pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Alternatively, run tests sequentially from the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1
7. Check for Unintentional Application Context Creation
Make sure you're not manually creating application contexts inside tests, such as:

java
Copy
Edit
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyConfig.class);
Instead, rely on Spring Boot’s test framework to manage context lifecycles.

8. Optimize EmbeddedKafka Initialization
If Embedded Kafka is causing context issues, ensure it is only initialized once per test suite:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@EmbeddedKafka(partitions = 1, topics = {"test-topic"})
public class KafkaTest {
}
Additionally, explicitly shut it down after tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void tearDownKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
}
Summary of Fixes
Potential Cause	Solution
Multiple context creation	Use @TestInstance to reuse context
Embedded Kafka triggering extra context	Profile isolation, teardown strategies
Overuse of @DirtiesContext	Remove or use selectively
Parallel test execution	Run tests sequentially
Reactive context conflicts	Use @WebFluxTest for WebFlux apps
Context not being properly closed	Manually close Spring context in @AfterAll
Next Steps
Check your test annotations (@SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest, etc.) and remove unnecessary context-loading configurations.

Enable debugging logs to confirm when and how many contexts are being created:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Try running tests sequentially to confirm whether concurrency is causing the issue.

You said:
Is there a way i can use embeddedkafka in cucumber without the annotation and destro it in predestroy
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use Embedded Kafka in your Cucumber tests without the @EmbeddedKafka annotation and instead manage its lifecycle manually by initializing it in the setup phase and destroying it in a @PreDestroy method.

Steps to Achieve This
1. Manual Initialization of Embedded Kafka in Cucumber Tests
Instead of using the annotation, you can programmatically initialize Embedded Kafka in a Cucumber @BeforeAll hook and shut it down in a @PreDestroy method.

Step Definitions Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClientConfig;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.DefaultKafkaProducerFactory;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaAdmin;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;
    private static KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Value("${spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers}")
    private String kafkaBootstrapServers;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setupKafka() {
        System.out.println("Starting Embedded Kafka...");

        embeddedKafkaBroker = new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound");
        embeddedKafkaBroker.afterPropertiesSet();  // Start the broker

        // Set up Kafka producer factory
        Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
        config.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());

        KafkaAdmin admin = new KafkaAdmin(config);
        kafkaTemplate = new KafkaTemplate<>(new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(admin.getConfigurationProperties()));

        System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());

        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka started at: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownKafka() {
        System.out.println("Destroying Embedded Kafka...");
        if (kafkaTemplate != null) {
            kafkaTemplate.destroy();
        }
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        }
    }
}
2. Explanation of the Implementation
Initialization (@BeforeAll):

Creates an EmbeddedKafkaBroker instance manually with specified topics.
Starts the broker with afterPropertiesSet().
Configures a Kafka template for producing test messages.
Sets the bootstrap server dynamically for application consumption.
Shutdown (@PreDestroy):

Ensures proper destruction of Kafka resources before the test context shuts down.
Cleans up the Kafka broker and producer factory.
3. Using the Embedded Kafka Instance in Step Definitions
Now, in your Cucumber steps, you can access the Kafka broker and produce/consume messages:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;

public class KafkaStepDefinitions {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Given("I produce a message to the topic")
    public void produceMessage() {
        kafkaTemplate.send("test-inbound", "key", "test message");
        System.out.println("Message sent to Kafka topic");
    }
}
4. Ensuring Proper Context Management in Tests
To ensure that the Kafka broker starts and stops correctly within the Cucumber test lifecycle, you can:

Use @DirtiesContext sparingly, only when the context must be refreshed.
Ensure Cucumber is configured properly with:
java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberSpringConfiguration {
}
5. Running the Tests
Execute tests normally via:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test
Observe the logs to verify that the Kafka broker starts before tests and shuts down after the tests complete.

Advantages of This Approach
Manual Lifecycle Control:

Allows precise control over Kafka instance start and stop.
Avoids conflicts with other test contexts.
Cleaner Resource Management:

Ensures Embedded Kafka is destroyed properly via @PreDestroy.
No lingering connections after test execution.
Flexibility:

Run tests with or without Embedded Kafka by controlling broker startup via profiles or conditions.
Possible Improvements
If you want finer control over Kafka initialization, you could move it inside a Spring Configuration class, then conditionally start it based on an environment variable:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound");
    }
}
Then you can conditionally load it using:

java
Copy
Edit
@IfProfileValue(name = "test.kafka.enabled", notValue = "false")
Conclusion
Yes, you can effectively use Embedded Kafka in Cucumber without annotations by:

Manually initializing it in @BeforeAll hook.
Cleaning it up in @PreDestroy.
Using dependency injection to access Kafka components in step definitions.
This approach provides better test isolation and flexibility without depending on annotations like @EmbeddedKafka.

Let me know if you need further clarifications!

You said:
Embeddedkafka is coming as null
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If EmbeddedKafkaBroker is coming as null in your test setup, it is likely due to issues related to bean lifecycle management, dependency injection, or test context configuration. Below are several steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

1. Ensure Proper Bean Initialization
Since you are manually creating EmbeddedKafkaBroker instead of using the @EmbeddedKafka annotation, ensure it is properly declared as a Spring bean in a configuration class.

Solution: Create a configuration class to define the Embedded Kafka broker bean:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound");
    }
}
Then inject it into your test lifecycle class:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    public void setEmbeddedKafkaBroker(EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker = broker;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The Kafka broker is now a managed Spring bean, ensuring it is available for injection.
The setter injection pattern allows safe assignment to a static field.
2. Ensure Test Context Loads the Configuration
Make sure the test context includes the Kafka configuration class by specifying it explicitly in your tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = {KafkaTestConfig.class})
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
If you are using Cucumber with Spring:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = {KafkaTestConfig.class})
public class CucumberSpringConfiguration {
}
3. Inject the Broker Using ApplicationContext
If the broker bean is not being autowired properly, try retrieving it manually from the Spring application context:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker = applicationContext.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
    if (broker != null) {
        broker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed via ApplicationContext.");
    }
}
4. Use Lazy Initialization to Ensure Bean Is Ready
If the broker is being accessed before it is fully initialized, consider using @Lazy annotation:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
@Lazy
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;
5. Check Test Setup for Conflicting Annotations
Avoid conflicts between @SpringBootTest and @WebMvcTest as the latter does not load the full application context.
If you're using @WebMvcTest, you may need to load the Kafka bean manually:
java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(controllers = MyController.class)
@Import(KafkaTestConfig.class)
public class MyControllerTest {
}
6. Enable Debug Logging for Dependency Resolution
Enable debug logs to check if the Kafka broker bean is being initialized in the context:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Look for logs like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean initialized
7. Verify Component Scanning and Bean Discovery
Ensure that your @Component annotated classes are within the same or a sub-package of your @SpringBootApplication class, or explicitly specify the package to scan:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.example")
8. Run Tests in Isolation to Avoid Context Conflicts
Try running the Kafka tests independently to isolate any dependency or context-related issues:

shell
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest=KafkaTest
Conclusion
If EmbeddedKafkaBroker is coming as null, follow these key steps:

Define it as a Spring bean using a @Configuration class.
Ensure correct test configuration via @SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class).
Inject via ApplicationContext to manually retrieve it in test teardown.
Check for conflicts in annotations to avoid partial context loading.
Enable debug logging to verify the bean lifecycle.
If you still encounter issues, please share details about your test class setup and context initialization for further assistance.

You said:
The only place where the embeddedkafka even comes up is when i add @embeddedkafka in the class annotated with@cucumbercontextconfigurayion
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the EmbeddedKafkaBroker is only being instantiated when you use the @EmbeddedKafka annotation in the class annotated with @CucumberContextConfiguration, it indicates that Spring Boot's test auto-configuration is responsible for setting it up. Without the annotation, Spring does not automatically provide the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean.

Why Embedded Kafka Works Only with @EmbeddedKafka
The @EmbeddedKafka annotation is part of spring-kafka-test, and it triggers the auto-configuration of an in-memory Kafka broker.
When used in combination with @CucumberContextConfiguration, it ensures that the broker is initialized within the test application context.
If the annotation is removed, Spring doesn't create the necessary Kafka-related beans automatically.
Solution: Manual Initialization Without @EmbeddedKafka
If you prefer to manually control Embedded Kafka without using the annotation, follow these steps:

1. Manually Register the Embedded Kafka Broker as a Bean
Create a configuration class to initialize the Kafka broker manually:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound");
    }
}
Then, in your Cucumber test setup, load this configuration explicitly:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class)
public class CucumberSpringConfiguration {
}
2. Use @BeforeAll to Start Kafka Manually
Instead of relying on Spring’s bean lifecycle, initialize the broker explicitly:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void startKafka() {
        System.out.println("Starting Embedded Kafka manually...");
        embeddedKafkaBroker = new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound");
        embeddedKafkaBroker.afterPropertiesSet();  // Starts the broker
        System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka started on: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void shutdownKafka() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down Embedded Kafka...");
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        }
    }
}
Ensure the above class is loaded in your test context.

3. Manually Inject and Destroy the Kafka Broker in Step Definitions
If you prefer to inject it in the Cucumber step definitions:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;

public class KafkaStepDefinitions {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Given("I send a message to Kafka")
    public void sendMessageToKafka() {
        kafkaTemplate.send("test-inbound", "key", "Test message");
        System.out.println("Message sent to Kafka topic: test-inbound");
    }
}
4. Add Kafka Properties to Test Profile
If the broker is manually created, you need to configure the test environment to use the broker’s bootstrap servers dynamically:

application-test.properties

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
Ensure the property is set in your test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
public class KafkaTest {
}
5. Validate Bean Availability
If Embedded Kafka is still null, check the available beans at runtime:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

@Test
public void printBeans() {
    for (String beanName : applicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
        System.out.println("Bean: " + beanName);
    }
}
This can help verify if the broker bean is being created correctly.

Summary of Solutions
Use a Configuration Class to Register Embedded Kafka:

Manually register it in a @Configuration class and include it in @SpringBootTest.
Manually Control the Kafka Lifecycle in Tests:

Use @BeforeAll to start and @PreDestroy to destroy the broker.
Inject Broker Using Spring's Application Context:

Retrieve the broker manually if necessary to avoid autowiring issues.
Enable Test Profile for Better Isolation:

Use a dedicated test profile to avoid conflicts with the main application.
Conclusion
If Embedded Kafka only starts when you use @EmbeddedKafka, it means the test context auto-configuration is handling its setup. To take full control and avoid relying on annotations:

Use manual initialization with a Spring configuration.
Ensure dependencies (spring-kafka-test) are correctly included.
Manage the broker lifecycle properly to avoid conflicts with other tests.

To use the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean in your tests without relying on the @EmbeddedKafka annotation, follow these steps:

1. Manually Define Embedded Kafka as a Spring Bean
First, create a Spring configuration class to provide the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound")
                .kafkaPorts(9092);  // Optional: Specify ports if needed
    }
}
2. Use the EmbeddedKafkaBroker Bean in Tests
Now you can inject the EmbeddedKafkaBroker into your test classes.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class)
public class KafkaTest {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void setupKafka(@Autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", broker.getBrokersAsString());
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka started at: " + broker.getBrokersAsString());
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void cleanupKafka(@Autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        broker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker destroyed.");
    }
}
Explanation:

@SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class): Ensures the custom Kafka bean is loaded.
embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString(): Retrieves the broker connection string for test usage.
System.setProperty: Sets the Kafka bootstrap servers dynamically in tests.
@BeforeAll and @AfterAll: Manage Kafka startup and shutdown manually.
3. Using EmbeddedKafkaBroker in Cucumber Tests
If you're using Cucumber, you can use the broker in your step definitions:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaTestLifecycle {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void startKafka(@Autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", broker.getBrokersAsString());
        System.out.println("Kafka Broker running at: " + broker.getBrokersAsString());
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void stopKafka(@Autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
        broker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Kafka Broker shut down.");
    }
}
4. Producing and Consuming Messages with the Embedded Broker
You can send and receive messages using Spring Kafka components.

Producer Configuration:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class KafkaProducerService {

    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    public KafkaProducerService(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String topic, String key, String message) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, key, message);
        System.out.println("Message sent to Kafka topic: " + topic);
    }
}
Consumer Configuration:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaConsumerService {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "test-outbound", groupId = "test-group")
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    }
}
Step Definition Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class KafkaStepDefinitions {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaProducerService kafkaProducerService;

    @Given("I send a message to Kafka topic {string}")
    public void sendMessageToKafka(String topic) {
        kafkaProducerService.sendMessage(topic, "key1", "test message");
    }
}
5. Verifying Messages Using Kafka Consumer Test Utilities
To verify whether messages were published and consumed correctly:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.utils.KafkaTestUtils;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.ConsumerFactory;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.Map;

@SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class)
public class KafkaConsumerTest {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Test
    public void testConsumeMessages() {
        Map<String, Object> consumerProps = KafkaTestUtils.consumerProps("test-group", "false", embeddedKafkaBroker);
        ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory = new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerProps);
        var consumer = consumerFactory.createConsumer();
        embeddedKafkaBroker.consumeFromAnEmbeddedTopic(consumer, "test-outbound");

        ConsumerRecord<String, String> record = KafkaTestUtils.getSingleRecord(consumer, "test-outbound");
        System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());

        assert record.value().equals("test message");
    }
}
6. Cleanup Strategy
Ensure Kafka resources are properly cleaned up after tests by leveraging Spring’s lifecycle hooks or JUnit cleanup methods:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void tearDown() {
    context.close();
}
Summary of Steps
Define Embedded Kafka as a Spring bean using @Configuration.
Inject the broker in tests using @Autowired.
Manually manage the broker lifecycle using @BeforeAll and @AfterAll.
Configure producers and consumers for integration testing.
Verify messages using Kafka test utilities.
Ensure proper resource cleanup to prevent test failures.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively use the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean in your tests without relying on annotations. This approach provides more flexibility in

You said:
Embeddedkafkazkbroker
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker is not a standard class or component provided by Spring Kafka or Apache Kafka. However, it seems like you're referring to an Embedded Kafka Broker with ZooKeeper, which was historically required by Kafka but has been phased out in later versions of Kafka.

Key Points to Understand
Modern Kafka Versions (Post 2.8+):
Kafka no longer requires ZooKeeper and can run in KRaft mode (Kafka Raft), which eliminates the dependency on ZooKeeper.
Embedded Kafka in Spring Boot:
The spring-kafka-test library provides the EmbeddedKafkaBroker class, which runs Kafka in an embedded mode for testing without ZooKeeper by default.
Using Embedded Kafka with ZooKeeper (Pre Kafka 2.8)
If you are using an older version of Kafka that requires ZooKeeper, the EmbeddedKafkaBroker can still manage a ZooKeeper instance internally.

1. Setting Up Embedded Kafka with ZooKeeper
Spring Kafka test library supports Kafka with ZooKeeper, and you can configure it using the following approach:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound", "test-outbound")
                .zkPort(2181);  // Set ZooKeeper port if needed
    }
}
Explanation:

new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "topic1", "topic2")
The first parameter is the number of brokers.
The second parameter (true) indicates whether ZooKeeper is enabled.
The third parameter is the number of partitions.
.zkPort(2181) specifies a port for the embedded ZooKeeper instance.
2. Accessing ZooKeeper from Embedded Kafka
If you need to interact with the embedded ZooKeeper instance, you can get its connection string from the broker:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

public void printZookeeperConnection() {
    System.out.println("ZooKeeper is running at: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getZookeeperConnectionString());
}
3. Running Kafka in KRaft Mode (Without ZooKeeper)
If you are using Kafka 2.8+, you can skip ZooKeeper by starting Embedded Kafka in KRaft mode, which does not require ZooKeeper.

java
Copy
Edit
new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, false, 1, "test-topic")
        .kafkaPorts(9092); // Use KRaft instead of ZooKeeper
4. Using Embedded Kafka in Tests Without Annotations
If you want to use Embedded Kafka manually (without @EmbeddedKafka), instantiate and manage it manually:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

public class KafkaZKTest {

    private static EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void startKafka() {
        embeddedKafkaBroker = new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-inbound")
                .zkPort(2181);  // ZooKeeper enabled with custom port
        embeddedKafkaBroker.afterPropertiesSet();
        System.out.println("Kafka started with ZooKeeper at: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getZookeeperConnectionString());
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void stopKafka() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        }
        System.out.println("Kafka broker and ZooKeeper shutdown.");
    }
}
5. Producing and Consuming Messages with Embedded Kafka and ZooKeeper
Producer Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class KafkaProducerService {
    
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    public KafkaProducerService(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String topic, String message) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, "key", message);
        System.out.println("Message sent to Kafka topic: " + topic);
    }
}
Consumer Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaConsumerService {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "test-inbound", groupId = "test-group")
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    }
}
6. Configuration Properties for Embedded Kafka with ZooKeeper
If running the application in a test profile, you can specify properties to dynamically use Embedded Kafka:

application-test.properties

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=test-group
spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset=earliest
Ensure that the property is set dynamically:

java
Copy
Edit
@BeforeAll
public static void setKafkaProperties() {
    System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
}
7. Debugging Embedded Kafka with ZooKeeper
If you face issues like connection failures or timeouts, try:

Enable debug logs for Kafka and Zookeeper:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.kafka=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
Verify ports are not conflicting with any local Kafka/ZooKeeper running on the system.

Check if spring-kafka-test dependency is correctly included:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
8. Shutting Down Embedded Kafka Properly
Ensure proper shutdown to avoid port conflicts in subsequent test runs:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void tearDown() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    System.out.println("Kafka broker shutdown complete.");
}
Conclusion
If you are looking for an embedded Kafka broker with ZooKeeper, you can achieve it by:

Using the EmbeddedKafkaBroker with zkPort() to enable ZooKeeper.
Managing the lifecycle manually via beforePropertiesSet() and destroy().
Switching to Kafka KRaft mode in newer versions (without ZooKeeper).
If your goal is to avoid ZooKeeper, ensure you're using Kafka 2.8+ and explicitly disable it in the broker settings.

Let me know if you need further clarifications!

You said:
No there is a class embeddedkafkazkbroker
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Apologies for any confusion in my earlier responses. You're correct; the EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker class is part of the Spring Kafka testing framework. This class facilitates the setup of embedded Kafka brokers along with an embedded ZooKeeper instance, which is essential for managing Kafka clusters, especially in versions prior to Kafka 2.8 where ZooKeeper is required.

Key Points:

Purpose: EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker is designed for unit tests that require an embedded Kafka environment with ZooKeeper. It simplifies the process of starting and stopping Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper within the test lifecycle.

Usage: This class is particularly useful when testing applications that interact with Kafka, allowing developers to run tests without the need for an external Kafka setup.

Implementation Details:

The EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker class implements the EmbeddedKafkaBroker interface and provides methods to manage the lifecycle of the embedded Kafka and ZooKeeper instances. It offers constructors to create embedded Kafka brokers with specified configurations, such as the number of brokers, controlled shutdown options, partitions, and topics.

Example Usage:

To utilize EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker in your tests, you can define it as a bean within a Spring configuration class and manage its lifecycle accordingly. Here's an example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker embeddedKafkaZKBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker(1, true, 1, "test-topic");
    }
}
In your test class, you can then autowire this bean and manage its lifecycle:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker;

@SpringBootTest(classes = KafkaTestConfig.class)
public class KafkaTest {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker embeddedKafkaZKBroker;

    @BeforeAll
    public void setUp() {
        embeddedKafkaZKBroker.afterPropertiesSet();
        System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", embeddedKafkaZKBroker.getBrokersAsString());
    }

    @AfterAll
    public void tearDown() {
        embeddedKafkaZKBroker.destroy();
    }

    // Your test methods here
}
Considerations:

Kafka Version Compatibility: Ensure that your Kafka client and broker versions are compatible. Incompatibilities can lead to issues during testing.

ZooKeeper Dependency: For Kafka versions 2.8 and above, Kafka can operate in KRaft mode, eliminating the need for ZooKeeper. However, if you're working with versions that require ZooKeeper, EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker is appropriate.

Spring Boot Version: Be aware of the Spring Boot version you're using, as certain versions may have compatibility issues with embedded Kafka setups. For instance, some users have reported issues with @EmbeddedKafka in Spring Boot 3.2 and above. 
STACK OVERFLOW

For more detailed information, you can refer to the official Spring Kafka documentation on testing: 
HOME

Additionally, the API documentation provides insights into the EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker class: 
HOME

By configuring and managing the EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker bean as shown, you can effectively incorporate an embedded Kafka environment with ZooKeeper into your tests, ensuring they run in isolation without the need for external Kafka and ZooKeeper instances.

You said:
I have asked producers to connect kafka on 9093 port they are not finding it there, how to know which port embeddedkafka is listening on
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To determine which port the Embedded Kafka broker is listening on, you can retrieve the broker's connection string dynamically during runtime using the EmbeddedKafkaBroker or EmbeddedKafkaZKBroker instance.

1. Retrieve Kafka Broker Port Programmatically
If you have an instance of EmbeddedKafkaBroker in your test class, you can get the dynamically assigned port using:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@Test
public void checkKafkaPort() {
    String brokers = embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString();
    System.out.println("Kafka broker running at: " + brokers);
}
Explanation:

getBrokersAsString() returns the bootstrap server address in the format: localhost:<port>.
The port can then be set dynamically for the producer/consumer configuration.
2. Use the Assigned Port in Tests
Once you obtain the dynamic port, set it for Kafka clients in your test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@BeforeAll
public static void setKafkaProperties(@Autowired EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker) {
    System.setProperty("spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers", broker.getBrokersAsString());
    System.out.println("Kafka is running on: " + broker.getBrokersAsString());
}
3. Define Fixed Kafka Port for Predictability
By default, Embedded Kafka assigns random ports, but you can configure it to use a fixed port for easier access.

Solution: Set Fixed Kafka Port in Configuration
Modify the Embedded Kafka bean to specify a port explicitly:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
    return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-topic")
            .kafkaPorts(9093);  // Force Kafka to listen on port 9093
}
Then you can set the port in your producer configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9093
Note: Ensure no other Kafka instance is already using port 9093, otherwise, Embedded Kafka might not bind to it.

4. Check Assigned Ports via Logs
You can enable logging to find the port Kafka is listening on:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.kafka=DEBUG
Once the application starts, look for a log similar to:

Copy
Edit
Started EmbeddedKafkaBroker at localhost:XXXX
5. Check Using Kafka Admin Client
You can programmatically verify the broker's details using Kafka Admin client:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private KafkaAdmin kafkaAdmin;

@Test
public void checkBrokerDetails() {
    System.out.println("Kafka broker address: " + kafkaAdmin.getConfigurationProperties().get("bootstrap.servers"));
}
6. Manually Inspect Kafka Ports
If you're unsure which port Kafka is running on, check the running processes on your machine using:

Linux/macOS:
bash
Copy
Edit
lsof -i :9093
Windows (PowerShell):
powershell
Copy
Edit
netstat -an | findstr 9093
If no output is found, it indicates Kafka might be running on a different port.

7. Validate Kafka Connectivity
To ensure that Kafka is accessible, you can use a simple connectivity check:

java
Copy
Edit
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9093");
props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

try (KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props)) {
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("test-topic", "key", "test-message"));
    System.out.println("Message sent successfully.");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("Failed to connect to Kafka: " + e.getMessage());
}
Conclusion
If your producer is not finding Kafka on port 9093, check the following:

Retrieve the correct port dynamically using embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString().
Set a fixed port in EmbeddedKafkaBroker for easier configuration.
Enable debug logging to verify the actual port assignment.
Inspect runtime processes to confirm which port Kafka is bound to.
Ensure producer configuration dynamically uses the correct port.

You said:
In the stepdef java class this bean is coming as null
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean is coming as null in your Cucumber step definition class, it likely indicates that the step definition class is not being managed by the Spring context properly. Below are several solutions to address this issue.

1. Ensure Cucumber is Integrated with Spring Properly
For Spring to inject beans in Cucumber step definitions, you need to ensure that Cucumber and Spring are properly integrated using the correct annotations.

Solution: Add @CucumberContextConfiguration
In your Cucumber integration configuration, add:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.spring.CucumberContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
Make sure your test runner references the correct glue package where the step definitions and configuration class are located.

java
Copy
Edit
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions"  // Ensure this matches the package containing step definitions
)
public class CucumberTestRunner {
}
2. Ensure Step Definition Class is a Spring Bean
Cucumber step definitions should be managed as Spring beans to enable dependency injection.

Solution: Use @Component Annotation
Add @Component to your step definition class to ensure it is picked up by Spring's component scanning:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaStepDefinitions {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @Given("I check the Kafka broker")
    public void checkKafkaBroker() {
        if (embeddedKafkaBroker == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("EmbeddedKafkaBroker is null!");
        }
        System.out.println("Kafka broker running at: " + embeddedKafkaBroker.getBrokersAsString());
    }
}
Ensure component scanning includes your step definition package in your main application class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.example")
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
3. Manually Retrieve Bean from Application Context
If @Autowired is not working in your step definitions, you can manually retrieve the bean from the Spring application context.

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class KafkaStepDefinitions {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Given("I retrieve the Kafka broker manually")
    public void retrieveKafkaBroker() {
        EmbeddedKafkaBroker broker = context.getBean(EmbeddedKafkaBroker.class);
        System.out.println("Kafka broker is running at: " + broker.getBrokersAsString());
    }
}
4. Verify Test Configuration Includes Kafka Bean
Ensure your test configuration includes a manually defined EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;

@Configuration
public class KafkaTestConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker() {
        return new EmbeddedKafkaBroker(1, true, 1, "test-topic")
                .kafkaPorts(9093);
    }
}
Then include this configuration in your test context:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = {KafkaTestConfig.class})
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
5. Check Cucumber Dependency Conflicts
Make sure you are using compatible versions of Cucumber and Spring Boot.

Example: Maven Dependencies

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependencies>
    <!-- Cucumber and Spring Boot -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId>
        <version>7.14.0</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Kafka Test Dependency -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Ensure you are not using conflicting versions of Cucumber and Spring dependencies.

6. Enable Debug Logs to Verify Context Loading
Enable debug logs in your test properties to check if the Spring context is loading properly.

In application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.io.cucumber=DEBUG
Run the test and check logs to confirm if the EmbeddedKafkaBroker bean is being initialized.

7. Run Tests with Context Caching Disabled
To ensure context is being reloaded properly, disable context caching temporarily to troubleshoot:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
8. Check Test Execution Order
Make sure the tests are not running in parallel and creating conflicts:

Modify pom.xml to add:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Conclusion and Next Steps
Ensure correct integration with Cucumber and Spring:

Use @CucumberContextConfiguration and @SpringBootTest.
Register Step Definition Class as a Spring Component:

Add @Component to step definition classes for Spring to manage them.
Manually retrieve the broker if needed:

Use ApplicationContext to fetch the bean in case @Autowired fails.
Check test configurations:

Ensure KafkaTestConfig is included and loaded correctly.
Review logging for insights:

Enable debug logging to verify bean initialization.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of EmbeddedKafkaBroker being null in your Cucumber step definitions. Let me know if you need further assistance!

You said:
The controller tests are triggered after cucumber and they fail with threshold(1), seems 1 of the bean already exists
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your controller tests are failing with the error threshold(1) after running Cucumber tests, it likely indicates that the Spring application context is not being properly cleaned up after the Cucumber tests, leading to a conflict when the controller tests attempt to initialize their own context.

Why This Happens
Application Context Already Exists:

Cucumber tests start the Spring context, and when the controller tests run, they try to create a new one but encounter the existing instance.
Some beans (like Embedded Kafka, database connections, etc.) may still be active in memory, causing the threshold issue.
Spring Context Caching Across Tests:

Spring Boot caches the context by default to improve test performance. However, if the same context is shared across different test types, it may lead to conflicts.
Kafka Broker Still Running:

The Embedded Kafka instance might not be properly shut down after the Cucumber tests, preventing the new context from being created.
Solutions to Fix the Issue
Solution 1: Use @DirtiesContext to Reset Context
You can use @DirtiesContext to ensure that the application context is reset after the Cucumber tests, allowing controller tests to start with a fresh context.

Add it to your Cucumber test configuration class:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
Explanation:

This annotation forces the context to be destroyed and recreated after the Cucumber test class is finished, preventing it from interfering with the next test.
Solution 2: Manually Close Application Context in Cucumber Tests
Ensure the application context is manually closed at the end of the Cucumber tests:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class CucumberHooks {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring context closed after Cucumber tests.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Ensures the Spring context is completely shut down before the next set of tests runs.
Solution 3: Isolate Test Configurations
Use separate profiles for Cucumber and controller tests to ensure they run with isolated configurations.

Define a test profile in application-cucumber.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
  profiles: cucumber
Cucumber test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest {
}
Controller test setup:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("controller")
public class ControllerTest {
}
Explanation:

This prevents configurations from overlapping and creating conflicts.
Solution 4: Explicitly Stop Embedded Kafka After Cucumber Tests
If the problem is caused by an Embedded Kafka instance lingering after the Cucumber tests, make sure to destroy it explicitly.

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class CucumberHooks {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDownKafka() {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka shut down after Cucumber tests.");
    }
}
Explanation:

Ensures Kafka does not interfere with the next test execution.
Solution 5: Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Overlapping Contexts
Modify Maven Surefire Plugin to run tests one by one:

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <forkCount>1</forkCount>
        <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
Explanation:

This ensures that tests do not run concurrently and cause resource conflicts.
Solution 6: Debug Context Creation to Identify Conflicts
Enable logging to see when and how many contexts are being created:

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.context=DEBUG
Look for entries like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
o.s.boot.SpringApplication : Starting application context
This can help identify if multiple contexts are being initialized.

Conclusion and Recommended Steps
First Try: Use @DirtiesContext on Cucumber tests to reset the context after tests.
Manually Close Kafka and Spring Context using @AfterAll to prevent lingering instances.
Use Test Profiles to separate Cucumber and controller test environments.
Ensure Tests Run Sequentially to prevent parallel execution conflicts.
Monitor Logs to check if the context is being duplicated.
By following these steps, you should be able to prevent the threshold(1) issue and allow the controller tests to run smoothly after the Cucumber tests.

You said:
If applications kafka producer and consumers are UP even after the tests are completed will the applicationcontext beans be destrooyed
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your application's Kafka producers and consumers are still running even after the tests are completed, it suggests that the Spring application context may not be shutting down properly. In a typical Spring Boot application:

If the application context is properly closed, then all beans, including Kafka producers and consumers, should be destroyed.
If producers/consumers are still running, it likely means the application context shutdown isn't happening correctly, or the beans are not being properly managed within the Spring lifecycle.
How Spring Application Context Manages Beans
When the application context is closed (via manual shutdown or JUnit test lifecycle methods):

Singleton beans (including Kafka consumers and producers) should be destroyed.
Beans annotated with @PreDestroy will have their cleanup methods executed.
Any Kafka components (such as KafkaListener) should stop listening.
Scenarios Where Beans May Not Be Destroyed Properly
Beans Not Managed by Spring Properly:

If the Kafka consumers/producers were initialized manually (outside of Spring context), they won’t be managed and thus won't be destroyed.
Application Context Not Closing Gracefully:

If tests don't properly shut down the Spring context, the Kafka components might still be alive in the background.
Asynchronous Processes:

Kafka consumers run asynchronously in separate threads and may continue running if not explicitly stopped.
How to Ensure Beans Are Destroyed Properly
1. Manually Shut Down Spring Application Context in Tests
Ensure the Spring context is properly shut down using:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;

public class TestLifecycle {

    @Autowired
    private static ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void shutdownContext() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
2. Use @PreDestroy to Clean Up Kafka Consumers and Producers
Ensure your Kafka beans have proper shutdown logic by adding @PreDestroy to cleanup resources when the context is destroyed.

java
Copy
Edit
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class KafkaProducerService {

    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    public KafkaProducerService(KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate) {
        this.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String topic, String message) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message);
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying Kafka producer...");
        kafkaTemplate.destroy();
    }
}
Explanation:

When the Spring context shuts down, @PreDestroy ensures that resources are released.
3. Stop Kafka Consumers Gracefully
If your consumers are running even after tests are completed, make sure they can be shut down using:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaConsumerService {

    private final Consumer<String, String> consumer;

    public KafkaConsumerService(Consumer<String, String> consumer) {
        this.consumer = consumer;
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "test-topic", groupId = "test-group")
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received: " + message);
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void stopConsumer() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down Kafka consumer...");
        consumer.wakeup();  // Graceful exit from poll()
    }
}
Explanation:

consumer.wakeup() is a non-blocking way to exit the Kafka poll loop gracefully.
4. Use @DirtiesContext in Tests to Force Context Cleanup
Adding @DirtiesContext ensures that the Spring context is destroyed after tests run.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class KafkaTest {
}
5. Verify Context Shutdown Using Logging
Add the following to your application.properties or test properties to verify if the context is shutting down correctly:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.context=DEBUG
Look for logs that indicate proper shutdown:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Closing org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
6. Ensure Embedded Kafka is Properly Destroyed
If you are using Embedded Kafka, ensure it is explicitly destroyed in test cleanup:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
    }
}
7. Check if Application Runs in a Separate Thread
If your application is running in a separate thread (e.g., SpringApplication.run() inside the test), ensure that it's properly terminated:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ApplicationTest {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void stopApplication() {
        if (context.isRunning()) {
            context.close();
        }
    }
}
8. Check for Long-Running Threads in Your Tests
Sometimes, background threads might keep Kafka consumers running. Check for such threads in your application and ensure they are terminated after tests.

Conclusion
If the Kafka producers and consumers are still running even after the tests:

Verify if the Spring application context is shutting down properly.

Use @AfterAll or context.close() manually to force a shutdown.
Ensure Kafka components are Spring-managed beans.

Use @PreDestroy to clean up producers and consumers.
Use @DirtiesContext to force a new test context.

Explicitly destroy Embedded Kafka broker.

Check for lingering threads and shut them down.

Following these steps should ensure that the Kafka components do not remain active after test execution. Let me know if you need more help!

You said:
But naturally the application consumer and producers should not be closed ever, as they are to function when app comes up and go down when app goes down
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct—in a production scenario, Kafka producers and consumers should remain running for the application's entire lifecycle, only shutting down when the application itself is terminated. However, when running tests, the goal is to ensure proper isolation and cleanup of resources between test runs.

Addressing the Issue in Tests
In your case, since the Kafka producers and consumers should remain running while the application is up and should not be manually stopped during normal operation, the issue may be due to:

Tests Not Fully Closing the Application Context:

If tests do not close the context properly, Kafka components continue running across test classes.
Spring Context Caching Across Tests:

If context caching is enabled, the same application context (with Kafka consumers/producers) might persist across tests, leading to the "threshold(1)" error when another test tries to start a new context.
Embedded Kafka Shutdown Conflicts:

Even if Kafka is embedded, tests should ensure it is shut down properly to allow a fresh instance when the next test starts.
Solutions to Ensure Proper Test Isolation While Keeping Kafka Running Normally
1. Ensure the Application Context is Fully Closed After Tests
To ensure the application shuts down completely after tests:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestLifecycleManager {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void shutdownAppContext() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

This approach ensures that Kafka consumers and producers will only go down when the application is fully terminated.
2. Use @DirtiesContext for Tests to Reload the Context Cleanly
Instead of manually shutting down the application, you can force Spring to destroy and reload the context between test classes:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class KafkaControllerTest {
}
Explanation:

This tells Spring to discard the current context and start fresh, ensuring no lingering consumers or producers.
3. Isolate Test Configurations Using Profiles
Use separate profiles for tests vs. production to avoid test interference:

application-test.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: ${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}
    consumer:
      group-id: test-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
Activate it in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@SpringBootTest
public class MyKafkaTest {
}
Explanation:

This approach keeps production consumers running and isolates test-specific configurations.
4. Run Tests Sequentially
Ensure tests run one after another to avoid conflicts with Kafka and application lifecycle.

Modify pom.xml to enforce sequential execution:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Explanation:

This prevents multiple test classes from trying to start conflicting application contexts.
5. Properly Manage Embedded Kafka
If you are using Embedded Kafka for testing, make sure it is properly initialized and destroyed.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void stopKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
}
6. Log and Monitor Active Beans After Test Execution
To confirm if beans (Kafka consumers/producers) are still active after tests, enable debug logging:

Add to application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
7. Check for Asynchronous Components
Kafka consumers run asynchronously; ensure no background threads continue to run unexpectedly. Use shutdown hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
@PreDestroy
public void shutdown() {
    System.out.println("Stopping Kafka consumers...");
}
Key Takeaways
In Production: Kafka consumers/producers should stay up until the application shuts down.
In Tests: Ensure proper cleanup by:
Using @DirtiesContext to reload the context.
Using separate profiles for test vs. production.
Ensuring tests run sequentially to avoid context conflicts.
Properly destroying the application context after tests.
Managing Embedded Kafka cleanup correctly.
By implementing these measures, you can ensure smooth test execution without affecting the expected behavior of your Kafka consumers and producers in production.

You said:
Afterall is static and autowired is not supported on static
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right—@Autowired does not work with static methods because Spring injects dependencies into instance variables of managed beans, and static methods/fields are not managed by the Spring context.

Solutions to Properly Close the Application Context in Tests
Instead of using @Autowired in a static method, here are a few correct ways to achieve the same goal:

1. Use a Setter to Store the Application Context in a Static Field
You can autowire the context into a non-static field and set it into a static variable using a setter method.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestLifecycleManager {

    private static ConfigurableApplicationContext appContext;

    @Autowired
    public void setApplicationContext(ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
        appContext = context;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void shutdownAppContext() {
        if (appContext != null && appContext.isActive()) {
            appContext.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The setter allows Spring to inject the context into an instance field, which is then stored in a static variable for later use in the static @AfterAll method.
2. Manually Fetch the Application Context from Spring in Static Methods
Instead of relying on autowiring, manually retrieve the application context within a static method.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestLifecycleManager implements ApplicationContextAware {

    private static ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ctx) {
        context = ctx;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void shutdownAppContext() {
        if (context instanceof ConfigurableApplicationContext) {
            ((ConfigurableApplicationContext) context).close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The ApplicationContextAware interface allows setting the application context manually.
The static method can then access the stored context reference.
3. Use Instance Methods Instead of Static
If possible, avoid using static methods and rely on JUnit 5 lifecycle annotations with non-static instance methods.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestLifecycleManager {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterEach
    public void shutdownAppContext() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

JUnit 5 allows the use of non-static @AfterEach or @AfterAll methods when using the @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) annotation.
4. Use Spring Boot's Test Execution Listeners for Cleanup
Spring Boot provides test execution listeners that can be used to perform cleanup at the end of the test suite.

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.TestExecutionListener;
import org.springframework.test.context.TestExecutionListeners;
import org.springframework.test.context.support.AbstractTestExecutionListener;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

@SpringBootTest
@TestExecutionListeners(EmbeddedKafkaShutdownListener.class)
public class KafkaTest {
}

class EmbeddedKafkaShutdownListener extends AbstractTestExecutionListener {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void afterTestClass(org.springframework.test.context.TestContext testContext) {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down after test class.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

The TestExecutionListener hooks into the Spring test lifecycle and ensures cleanup after all tests.
5. Closing Application Context in Test Class with Non-Static Methods
If you want to close the context within the test class itself, use instance methods:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

@SpringBootTest
public class MyKafkaTest {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public void cleanUp() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

In JUnit 5, using non-static @AfterAll requires the @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) annotation.
Conclusion and Recommended Solution
Since @Autowired cannot work with static methods, the best way to ensure proper Spring context shutdown without static methods is:

Using setter injection into a static field (Solution 1) – Recommended.
Manually retrieving the Spring context via ApplicationContextAware (Solution 2).
Switching to JUnit 5 and using instance methods (Solution 3).
Leveraging test execution listeners (Solution 4).
These approaches will help gracefully shut down the application context after tests without facing dependency injection limitations.

You said:
If two tests 1 with cucumberintegration itb springboot and 1 with controller run with @springboottest and they are run in maven clean install, what happens tell me all about the spring handling and context creation in both cases
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
When you run two test classes in a Maven clean install build—one using Cucumber integration with @SpringBootTest, and the other a controller test with @SpringBootTest, the way Spring handles application context creation and management depends on various factors such as caching, profiles, and configurations.

1. Spring Context Handling Overview
Spring Boot's testing framework is designed to optimize test execution by reusing the application context whenever possible. Here’s how it behaves in your scenario:

Test 1: Cucumber Integration Test (@SpringBootTest)
This test loads the entire application context, including:
Controllers
Services
Repositories
External components (such as Kafka)
If @CucumberContextConfiguration is used, it integrates Cucumber with the Spring context lifecycle.
The context is initialized before the first Cucumber scenario and is typically reused across scenarios, unless otherwise specified using @DirtiesContext.
Test 2: Controller Test (@SpringBootTest)
Loads the full application context, similar to Cucumber, but with a focus on the controller layer.
Depending on test configuration (e.g., if @WebMvcTest is used instead, only the web layer is loaded).
By default, Spring tries to reuse the context created by the Cucumber test if configurations match.
2. Context Creation Process During Maven Build
When running mvn clean install, Maven executes the test lifecycle sequentially. Here’s what happens under the hood:

Step 1: Maven Build Execution
mvn clean: Deletes the target/ directory, ensuring a clean build.
mvn install: Compiles the code, runs tests, and installs artifacts.
Step 2: Test Execution
Spring Boot's test framework creates and manages the application context as follows:

First Test Class Runs (Cucumber Test)

The application context is initialized for the first test.
Spring caches this context for reuse in subsequent tests to improve test execution time.
If @DirtiesContext is applied, it forces context refresh after this test.
Second Test Class Runs (Controller Test)

If the context configurations (beans, profiles, properties) match those of the Cucumber test, Spring reuses the existing context.
If configurations differ, a new context is created, leading to additional startup time and memory consumption.
3. When Will Spring Reuse or Create a New Context?
Spring will reuse the application context across test classes if:

The same configuration is used (@SpringBootTest(classes = MyApp.class)).
The same active profiles are used (e.g., @ActiveProfiles("test")).
No test uses @DirtiesContext to mark the context as dirty.
Tests run in the same JVM instance (not forked by Maven).
Spring will create a new context if:

Different configuration classes are provided in @SpringBootTest:
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = AppConfig.class)
public class CucumberTest { }

@SpringBootTest(classes = AnotherConfig.class)
public class ControllerTest { }
Different active profiles are used in tests.
@DirtiesContext is used to force a refresh.
Tests are running in separate Maven forked JVMs (mvn surefire:failsafe with forkCount > 1).
4. Expected Behavior of Your Scenario
Case 1: Tests Use Identical Configurations
If both Cucumber and Controller tests use the same Spring Boot configuration, the same context will be reused, leading to:
Faster test execution.
Shared beans (like Kafka consumers, producers, or database connections).
Potential side effects if tests modify shared state.
Case 2: Tests Use Different Configurations
If the tests have different configurations (e.g., different profiles, properties, or component scanning), Spring creates two separate contexts, leading to:
Increased memory usage and startup time.
Potential test isolation (no shared state).
Case 3: One Test Marks Context as Dirty
If @DirtiesContext is used in any test, it forces the destruction and recreation of the context after test execution.
This ensures test isolation but results in higher execution time.
Case 4: Parallel Execution (Maven Forking Enabled)
If tests are run in parallel (e.g., Maven Surefire with forkCount > 1), separate JVMs might be used, resulting in:
Independent contexts per test class.
No context sharing across parallel JVMs.
5. Optimizing Test Execution
If context reuse is causing issues, consider these optimizations:

Use Separate Profiles for Tests:

Create distinct profiles for Cucumber and Controller tests to isolate the context:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest { }

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("controller")
public class ControllerTest { }
Selective Context Loading Using Test Slices:
Instead of @SpringBootTest, use test slices to load only relevant parts:

Use @WebMvcTest for controller tests:
java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
public class ControllerTest { }
Use @DataJpaTest for repository tests.
Limit Parallel Execution:
Modify pom.xml to ensure tests run sequentially to avoid conflicting contexts.

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Manually Close Context After Tests:
Ensure context shutdown to release resources:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void tearDown(@Autowired ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
    }
}
6. Summary of Context Behavior in Your Case
Scenario	Context Reuse?	Expected Behavior
Identical Configurations	Yes	Faster, shared context across tests.
Different Configurations	No	Separate contexts, longer test times.
@DirtiesContext Used	No	Context reset after the test class.
Maven Parallel Execution	No	Separate contexts due to multiple JVMs.
Conclusion
If configurations match, Spring reuses the context to optimize performance.
If configurations differ, or @DirtiesContext is used, a new context is created.
To ensure clean test isolation, use different profiles or explicitly close the context.
Running tests sequentially will prevent unexpected behavior due to shared context issues.

You said:
I don't see any configuration file with "test" in it but classes are marked with profile test
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you have test classes annotated with @ActiveProfiles("test") but do not see any configuration file named application-test.properties or application-test.yml, Spring Boot will still attempt to activate the "test" profile, and the behavior will depend on the following factors:

What Happens When @ActiveProfiles("test") Is Used Without a Profile-Specific Configuration File?
Default Application Properties Are Used:
If no application-test.properties or application-test.yml exists, Spring Boot will fall back to the default configuration, typically from:

application.properties
application.yml
application.yaml (if present)
Example: If you have a generic application.properties file, the properties defined there will still apply even though the profile test is activated.

Bean Definitions with @Profile("test") Will Be Activated:
If there are beans in your application with:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class TestConfig {
    // Beans specific to the test profile
}
These beans will be loaded only if the profile test is active, even without a profile-specific properties file.

No Profile-Specific Beans Are Loaded:
If no beans are explicitly marked with @Profile("test"), then all beans in the application context (without a profile restriction) will still be loaded.

Implicit Defaults Applied by Spring Boot:
When the test profile is activated, some Spring Boot auto-configurations might behave differently, such as:

Using an embedded database instead of the configured database.
Disabling certain caching mechanisms or optimizations used in production.
How to Verify the Active Profile Being Used
You can verify if the profile is being activated correctly by enabling logging.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
You should see logs like:

bash
Copy
Edit
o.s.b.w.e.env.EnvironmentPostProcessor: The following profiles are active: test
Alternatively, print the active profile in your test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class MyTest {

    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    @Test
    public void testActiveProfile() {
        System.out.println("Active Profile: " + Arrays.toString(environment.getActiveProfiles()));
    }
}
Recommended Actions If No Profile-Specific Configurations Exist
1. Add a Test Profile Configuration (Recommended)
If you're running tests using @ActiveProfiles("test"), it's best to create a application-test.properties or application-test.yml file under src/test/resources/ to ensure proper isolation.

Example: src/test/resources/application-test.properties

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9093
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Example: src/test/resources/application-test.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9093
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework: DEBUG
2. Remove the @ActiveProfiles Annotation If Not Needed
If the application works fine with the default properties, consider removing the @ActiveProfiles("test") annotation unless it's actually required.

3. Use Conditional Property Loading
You can define properties conditionally in your default application.properties file using Spring's profile-aware syntax:

properties
Copy
Edit
# Default properties (common to all profiles)
app.name=MyApp

# Test profile-specific properties
---
spring.config.activate.on-profile=test
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
logging.level.root=DEBUG
4. Verify Profile-Specific Beans
If there are no test-specific beans, review your application's configuration classes to see if any components are conditionally loaded based on the profile.

Example of a profile-specific bean:

java
Copy
Edit
@Service
@Profile("test")
public class TestService {
    public String getData() {
        return "Data for test profile";
    }
}
If this bean is not loaded, the profile might not be properly activated.

5. Add a Default Profile as Fallback
If no profile-specific files exist and no specific profile is active, you can set a fallback profile in your test classes:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.profiles.default=test")
public class MyTest {
}
This ensures that the test profile is used when no explicit profile is provided.

Summary of Spring Boot Behavior When Using @ActiveProfiles("test") Without Config Files
Scenario	Expected Behavior
No application-test.properties/yml	Default properties are used from application.*.
Beans annotated with @Profile("test")	They are activated when profile test is active.
No test profile beans exist	Default beans are loaded.
Spring Boot test optimizations	Some defaults (e.g., H2 DB, disabled caching).
Conclusion:
If you're using @ActiveProfiles("test") but no specific profile configuration file exists, Spring Boot will:

Use default configurations from application.properties or application.yml.
Load beans annotated with @Profile("test").
Apply default testing configurations (like H2 DB, embedded Kafka).
Fail if required test-specific properties are missing.
If you're facing issues or unexpected behavior, consider adding an explicit application-test.properties file or verifying if profile-based beans are being loaded correctly.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

You said:
In the afterall of cucumber i closed the application context, still controller tests when they run say a bean already exists
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you've closed the application context in the @AfterAll hook of your Cucumber tests, but the controller tests still fail with an error stating "a bean already exists," it suggests that:

The Spring Context Is Not Fully Destroyed Properly:

Some lingering components, such as Kafka consumers or singleton beans, might still be active due to background threads.
Spring might not have cleared context caches entirely.
Spring Context Is Being Cached Across Test Classes:

Even after manually closing the context, Spring Test framework could be caching it across test classes.
Parallel Execution or Forking in Maven:

Tests might be running in separate forks, which could cause new contexts to load unexpectedly.
Possible Solutions to Fully Reset Context Between Tests
1. Ensure Proper Context Destruction with @DirtiesContext
Even though you're closing the context manually, Spring may still hold onto cached instances. To force full context destruction:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
Why?

@DirtiesContext ensures the context is properly cleaned up after the entire test class finishes.
If you use classMode = AFTER_CLASS, the context is removed only after all tests in the class have run.
2. Add an Explicit Shutdown Hook for Kafka and Other Beans
If Kafka consumers/producers are still running after Cucumber tests, they might hold onto the context.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownApplication() {
    if (context.isActive()) {
        context.close();
        System.out.println("Spring context closed.");
    }
}
Additional Cleanup in Kafka Components:

java
Copy
Edit
@PreDestroy
public void cleanUpKafkaResources() {
    System.out.println("Shutting down Kafka consumers...");
    kafkaConsumer.wakeup();
}
3. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Context Conflicts
If tests are running in parallel, you might experience context interference. Ensure that tests run sequentially by modifying the Surefire plugin in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Alternatively, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
Why?

This ensures that all tests run in a single JVM, preventing separate contexts from conflicting with each other.
4. Verify Embedded Kafka Is Destroyed Properly
If you're using Embedded Kafka, it might still be holding onto resources.

Ensure it is properly shut down:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void tearDownKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
}
5. Debug the Bean Lifecycle to Identify Persisting Beans
Enable detailed logs to track bean creation and destruction:

In application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
In the test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@Test
public void checkBeans() {
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(context.getBeanDefinitionNames()));
}
What to Look For:

Check if any beans related to Kafka, database connections, or other resources persist across tests.
6. Isolate Test Configurations Using Profiles
If the controller and Cucumber tests share configurations, there might be unintended overlap. Use distinct profiles for each:

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberTest {
}

@ActiveProfiles("controller")
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
}
Create application-cucumber.properties and application-controller.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
# application-cucumber.properties
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9093

# application-controller.properties
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9094
7. Manually Destroy the Spring Context Using Hooks
If closing the context in @AfterAll is not sufficient, try leveraging:

java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberSpringConfig {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        if (context != null && context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Context closed in tearDown.");
        }
    }
}
8. Check for Custom Bean Initialization Outside of Spring Context
Sometimes, beans initialized manually (e.g., via new SomeBean()) might persist outside Spring's lifecycle.

Make sure all beans are defined within Spring’s context using:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyKafkaComponent {
    // Beans should be inside the Spring context
}
Conclusion: Steps to Try Next
Use @DirtiesContext(AFTER_CLASS) in Cucumber tests to force cleanup.
Ensure ConfigurableApplicationContext.close() is called properly.
Run tests sequentially (-DforkCount=1).
Ensure Embedded Kafka is explicitly destroyed.
Enable debug logging to track bean lifecycle.
Use distinct test profiles to isolate configurations.
If none of these work, please share the exact error message you're getting (e.g., stack trace or logs) so I can provide more targeted troubleshooting.

You said:
If a bean is using @Bean how to set their Predestroy
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If a bean is defined using the @Bean annotation in a Spring @Configuration class, you can set up a pre-destroy method using the following approaches:

1. Use @PreDestroy in the Bean Class
If you control the bean's source code, you can annotate a cleanup method with @PreDestroy in the bean itself.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something...");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up MyBean before shutdown...");
    }
}
Usage in configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
What happens?

When the application context is closed, the cleanup() method will be called automatically.
2. Use a destroyMethod Attribute in the @Bean Annotation
If you don't control the bean's source code, you can specify a destroy method in the @Bean annotation.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "close")
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
In the bean class:

java
Copy
Edit
public class MyBean {
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up resources in MyBean...");
    }
}
Explanation:

The destroyMethod = "close" tells Spring to call the close() method when the application shuts down.
3. Implement DisposableBean Interface
Another way is to implement Spring's DisposableBean interface in the bean class.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean;

public class MyBean implements DisposableBean {

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying MyBean using DisposableBean interface...");
    }
}
Usage in configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
What happens?

The destroy() method will be automatically called when the application context is shut down.
4. Use @Bean with Lambda for Destruction Logic
If you prefer to define the destruction logic directly in the @Bean declaration, you can use Java lambdas:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "")
    public Runnable shutdownHook(MyBean myBean) {
        return () -> {
            Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> myBean.close()));
        };
    }
}
Explanation:

The shutdownHook bean will register a shutdown hook to clean up resources when the context closes.
5. Using @Bean with Custom Destruction Callbacks
If you need custom cleanup logic for third-party beans that do not have a shutdown method, you can use the destroyMethod="" with a @Bean definition and provide your own cleanup logic:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "")
    public MyBean myBean() {
        MyBean myBean = new MyBean();
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> myBean.cleanupResources()));
        return myBean;
    }
}
Explanation:

destroyMethod = "" prevents Spring from calling any default destroy method.
A shutdown hook manually handles cleanup.
6. Registering Destruction Callbacks Manually
You can also manually register destruction callbacks for beans using ConfigurableBeanFactory:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean(ConfigurableBeanFactory beanFactory) {
        MyBean bean = new MyBean();
        beanFactory.registerSingleton("myBean", bean);
        beanFactory.registerDisposableBean("myBean", () -> bean.cleanupResources());
        return bean;
    }
}
7. Lifecycle Callbacks Using InitializingBean and DisposableBean
Spring also allows lifecycle management via interfaces:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean;

public class MyBean implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean {
    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Bean is initialized.");
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Bean is destroyed.");
    }
}
Best Practices
If you control the bean's code, use @PreDestroy as it is the most standard and readable way.
If it's a third-party bean, use destroyMethod in the @Bean declaration.
If you need custom behavior, consider manually adding shutdown hooks.
Conclusion
If you want to set up a destruction method for a @Bean, you have multiple options:

Add @PreDestroy in the bean class.
Use the destroyMethod attribute in @Bean.
Implement DisposableBean in the bean.
Use a shutdown hook manually.
Register destruction callbacks programmatically.

You said:
Any way to force the context to  lose and destroy the beans
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can force the Spring application context to close and destroy all beans explicitly during test execution or application shutdown. Here are several ways to ensure that the context is fully destroyed, and beans are properly cleaned up.

1. Manually Close the Application Context in Tests
You can manually close the application context using the ConfigurableApplicationContext interface.

Example in a test class:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TestLifecycleManager {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown(TestLifecycleManager manager) {
        if (manager.context.isActive()) {
            manager.context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context closed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

This will explicitly close the Spring context and destroy all beans when the test class finishes execution.
2. Use @DirtiesContext to Force Context Reset
Spring provides @DirtiesContext to mark the test context as dirty and force it to be closed and recreated for subsequent tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyTest {
    
    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        System.out.println("Running test...");
    }
}
Options for classMode:

AFTER_CLASS: Destroys context after the test class finishes.
AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD: Destroys and recreates context after each test method.
3. Using SpringApplication.exit() to Shut Down the Context
You can use SpringApplication.exit() to shut down the application context manually.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

@SpringBootTest
public class ContextShutdownTest {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void closeContext(ContextShutdownTest testInstance) {
        int exitCode = SpringApplication.exit(testInstance.context);
        System.out.println("Spring context closed with exit code: " + exitCode);
    }
}
Explanation:

SpringApplication.exit() ensures all beans, including shutdown hooks, are executed before termination.
4. Using @PreDestroy for Cleanup in Beans
Ensure individual beans are properly destroyed when the context shuts down.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {
    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up MyBean before shutdown...");
    }
}
What Happens:

When the application context is closed, @PreDestroy methods in beans are called.
5. Register a Shutdown Hook Manually
You can manually register a shutdown hook for the Spring context, which ensures cleanup during JVM shutdown.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

@SpringBootTest
public class ShutdownHookTest {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @Test
    public void registerShutdownHook() {
        context.registerShutdownHook();
        System.out.println("Shutdown hook registered.");
    }
}
Explanation:

context.registerShutdownHook() ensures cleanup when the JVM exits.
6. Forcing Destruction of Specific Beans
If you want to destroy specific beans explicitly, you can retrieve them from the context and call their cleanup method manually.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BeanDestroyTest {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void destroyBeans(BeanDestroyTest beanDestroyTest) {
        MyBean myBean = (MyBean) beanDestroyTest.context.getBean(MyBean.class);
        myBean.cleanup();
        System.out.println("MyBean destroyed manually.");
    }
}
7. Running Tests Sequentially to Prevent Context Reuse
If you're facing issues with context reuse, force Maven to run tests sequentially:

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
</configuration>
Alternatively, run the tests sequentially via:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
8. Using TestExecutionListener for Cleanup
You can implement a custom Spring Test Execution Listener to close the context after all tests:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.test.context.TestContext;
import org.springframework.test.context.support.AbstractTestExecutionListener;

public class CustomTestExecutionListener extends AbstractTestExecutionListener {
    @Override
    public void afterTestClass(TestContext testContext) {
        testContext.getApplicationContext().close();
        System.out.println("Context closed via TestExecutionListener.");
    }
}
Register it in your test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestExecutionListeners(CustomTestExecutionListener.class)
public class TestClass {
}
9. Using @SpringBootTest with WebEnvironment.NONE
If you don't need the full web server, use:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class NoWebServerTest {
}
This ensures a minimal context is loaded and can be destroyed faster.

10. Using Conditional Bean Destruction
If you want beans to be destroyed only in specific scenarios (e.g., during tests), use conditional properties.

Example in application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
mybean.destroy=true
In the bean class:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyBean {
    @Value("${mybean.destroy:false}")
    private boolean destroy;

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        if (destroy) {
            System.out.println("Destroying MyBean for tests...");
        }
    }
}
Summary of Strategies to Destroy Spring Context and Beans
Approach	Description
context.close()	Manually closes the application context.
@DirtiesContext	Forces context reset after each test class/method.
SpringApplication.exit()	Shuts down context programmatically.
@PreDestroy	Bean-level cleanup before context destruction.
Shutdown Hooks	Registers JVM shutdown hooks for cleanup.
TestExecutionListener	Custom listener to close context after tests.
Conclusion
If you're looking to force the Spring application context to close and destroy beans, the best approaches are:

Use context.close() in test lifecycle methods (@AfterAll).
Leverage @DirtiesContext for complete teardown and rebuild.
Ensure beans implement @PreDestroy or DisposableBean.
Use SpringApplication.exit() for complete cleanup.
Run tests sequentially to avoid parallel context issues.
Let me know if you need further clarification or help!

You said:
After adding dirtiest context the controller tests fail with "no context"
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your controller tests fail with "no context" after adding @DirtiesContext, it indicates that the test framework attempted to access the application context after it was marked as dirty and destroyed, meaning Spring discarded it and did not recreate it for subsequent tests.

Why This Happens
Incorrect Context Management:

When @DirtiesContext is used, the application context is marked for shutdown after the test class completes, making it unavailable for further use.
Dependency Injection Timing Issue:

If there are shared dependencies or autowired components relying on a cached context, they may not be re-initialized properly in the next test execution.
Parallel Execution Conflicts:

If tests are running concurrently (mvn test with parallel execution), the context may not be available when required.
Solutions to Fix the "No Context" Issue
1. Use @DirtiesContext Selectively
Instead of applying @DirtiesContext globally, use it only on tests that modify the context, to minimize disruptions to other tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class KafkaIntegrationTest {
    // Test methods
}
Then, allow the controller tests to use the existing cached context.

2. Ensure Fresh Context for Each Test Class
If tests require fresh contexts, apply @DirtiesContext at the method level, which forces a new context only for specific methods.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {

    @Test
    @DirtiesContext
    public void testControllerEndpoint() {
        // This test will force a fresh context after execution
    }
}
3. Ensure Tests Run Sequentially
If tests are being executed concurrently and the context is being discarded mid-execution, enforce sequential execution to avoid conflicts.

Modify the Maven Surefire plugin in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Alternatively, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
4. Explicitly Restart the Application Context
If you need to close and restart the context manually, use:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

public class ApplicationContextTest {

    private static ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void restartContext() {
        if (context != null) {
            context.close();
            context = SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class);
        }
    }
}
5. Check Test Annotations for Conflicts
Make sure you are not mixing test slice annotations like @WebMvcTest with @SpringBootTest, which may lead to conflicting contexts.

Example:

If you only need the web layer, prefer:
java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
Instead of:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
}
6. Verify Correct Context Injection
If your tests depend on autowired components, ensure they are initialized after the context is available:

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

@BeforeEach
public void setUp() {
    assertNotNull(context, "Spring context should be available");
}
7. Use @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) to Manage Context Across Tests
JUnit 5 allows context reuse across test methods when using:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
}
This prevents the need for context recreation and reduces the likelihood of "no context" errors.

8. Debug Context Destruction and Creation
Enable Spring debug logs to trace when contexts are being created and destroyed:

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
You should see logs like:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Closing org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
This will help confirm whether the context is being discarded prematurely.

Conclusion and Recommended Approach
If adding @DirtiesContext is causing the controller tests to fail due to "no context" errors, follow these steps:

Use @DirtiesContext selectively—preferably at the method level.
Ensure sequential execution using Maven settings.
Restart the context manually if needed using SpringApplication.run().
Use test slices like @WebMvcTest for lightweight testing.
Check for mixed annotations in test classes to avoid conflicts.
Log context destruction events to diagnose unexpected behavior.
If you need more assistance, feel free to provide details about your test class structure and configurations.

You said:
Where should be this added in stepdefinition class or cucumberconfigaration class
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The placement of @DirtiesContext depends on what you are trying to achieve:

If you want to clean up the Spring context after all Cucumber scenarios have run, add @DirtiesContext in the Cucumber configuration class (e.g., CucumberSpringConfig).

If you want to reset the context after specific scenarios or feature files, consider adding context cleanup logic inside your step definition class.

1. Adding @DirtiesContext in the Cucumber Configuration Class
If you want to ensure that the context is discarded and refreshed after all Cucumber tests, add it in the class annotated with @CucumberContextConfiguration.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.spring.CucumberContextConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.annotation.DirtiesContext;

@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberSpringConfig {
}
When to Use:

This approach ensures the Spring context is destroyed only after all Cucumber tests complete, ensuring performance efficiency.
It is suitable when Cucumber tests modify shared application state that could affect subsequent tests.
2. Adding @DirtiesContext at the Step Definition Class Level
If you want to refresh the context after each scenario or feature, add @DirtiesContext inside the step definition class.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.test.annotation.DirtiesContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD)
public class StepDefinition {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @Then("I verify the context")
    public void checkContext() {
        System.out.println("Running step definition with context: " + context);
    }
}
When to Use:

This approach resets the context after each Cucumber scenario, ensuring no shared state.
It might slow down test execution due to repeated context reloads but ensures test isolation.
3. Using Hooks to Manually Close the Context
If you want more control over context cleanup, you can manually close the Spring application context in Cucumber hooks.

Example in Step Definitions:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.After;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Hooks {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring context closed after scenario.");
        }
    }
}
When to Use:

This is useful if you want to manually trigger cleanup only under specific conditions (e.g., after long-running scenarios).
4. Using Cucumber Hooks in Configuration Class
Alternatively, you can centralize cleanup logic inside your Cucumber configuration using @BeforeAll and @AfterAll.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

public class CucumberLifecycleHooks {

    private static ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @BeforeAll
    public static void startApplication() {
        context = SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApp.class);
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void stopApplication() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring context closed after all tests.");
        }
    }
}
Best Approach Based on Your Needs
Scenario	Recommended Approach
Clean up after all Cucumber tests	Add @DirtiesContext in Cucumber configuration
Clean up after each scenario	Use @DirtiesContext in Step Definition
Clean up manually at specific points	Use @After hook in Step Definition
Full control over context lifecycle	Use @BeforeAll and @AfterAll hooks
Conclusion
If you want to clear the context after all Cucumber tests,

Add @DirtiesContext(classMode = AFTER_CLASS) in CucumberSpringConfig.
If you need context cleanup after each scenario,

Add @DirtiesContext(classMode = AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD) in the step definition class.
If you need manual control,

Use the @After Cucumber hook in the step definition.
For optimal performance,

Avoid frequent context reloads unless necessary to avoid slowing down test execution.

You said:
What if only a single bean needs to be destroyed 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you need to destroy only a single bean within the Spring application context, without affecting the entire context, you have several approaches to achieve this. Depending on whether you control the bean or not, you can:

Use @PreDestroy within the bean itself.
Manually remove the bean from the context.
Use Spring's DisposableBean interface.
Invoke the bean's destroy method via ConfigurableBeanFactory.
Use a custom destruction callback.
1. Use @PreDestroy to Cleanup the Bean Automatically
If you control the bean's source code, the easiest way is to add the @PreDestroy annotation to ensure cleanup before the bean is removed.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something...");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up MyBean before shutdown...");
    }
}
Explanation:

When the context is closed, the cleanup() method is called automatically for the bean.
2. Manually Remove the Bean from Application Context
If the bean is managed by the Spring context, you can manually remove it at runtime.

Example in Step Definition or Test:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BeanRemovalService {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    public void removeBean() {
        if (applicationContext.containsBean("myBean")) {
            ((ConfigurableApplicationContext) applicationContext).getBeanFactory().destroySingleton("myBean");
            System.out.println("MyBean has been destroyed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

destroySingleton("myBean") will remove the bean from the application context.
Use applicationContext.containsBean("myBean") to check if the bean exists before removal.
3. Implement DisposableBean Interface in the Bean
If you want more control over the bean's destruction logic, implement Spring's DisposableBean interface.

Bean Definition:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean implements DisposableBean {

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying MyBean...");
    }
}
Explanation:

When Spring destroys the bean (e.g., when the context is closed), the destroy() method will be called.
4. Invoke the Bean’s Destroy Method via ConfigurableBeanFactory
You can explicitly call the bean's destroy method when needed.

Example in Step Definition or Test:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BeanDestroyHandler {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableBeanFactory beanFactory;

    public void destroyMyBean() {
        MyBean myBean = (MyBean) beanFactory.getBean("myBean");
        beanFactory.destroyBean(myBean);
        System.out.println("MyBean has been destroyed manually.");
    }
}
Explanation:

beanFactory.destroyBean(myBean) invokes the destroy method and removes the bean.
5. Register a Custom Destruction Callback
If the bean does not support @PreDestroy or DisposableBean, you can register a custom destruction callback.

Example in Configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class BeanConfig {

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "")
    public MyBean myBean(ConfigurableBeanFactory beanFactory) {
        MyBean bean = new MyBean();
        beanFactory.registerDisposableBean("myBean", () -> bean.cleanup());
        return bean;
    }
}
Explanation:

This registers a custom cleanup logic for the bean using registerDisposableBean.
6. Destroy a Singleton Bean Manually Using removeBeanDefinition
If the bean is not a prototype but defined in the Spring container as a singleton, you can remove it manually.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BeanDestroyer {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    public void destroyBean() {
        ConfigurableListableBeanFactory factory = context.getBeanFactory();
        if (factory.containsBeanDefinition("myBean")) {
            factory.destroySingleton("myBean");
            System.out.println("Bean myBean destroyed.");
        }
    }
}
7. Cucumber Hooks for Manual Bean Cleanup
If you're running Cucumber tests and want to clean up the bean after a scenario or feature:

Example Using @After Hook:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.After;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CucumberHooks {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        ((ConfigurableApplicationContext) context).getBeanFactory().destroySingleton("myBean");
        System.out.println("MyBean destroyed after scenario.");
    }
}
8. Using Conditional Property-Based Destruction
If bean destruction depends on a profile or property, conditionally call cleanup logic:

Example with Spring Properties:

java
Copy
Edit
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() {
    if (Boolean.parseBoolean(System.getProperty("test.cleanup"))) {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up MyBean for tests...");
    }
}
Usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dtest.cleanup=true
Summary of Ways to Destroy a Single Bean
Approach	When to Use
@PreDestroy Annotation	When you control the bean source code
destroySingleton via Context	When dynamically managing bean lifecycle
Implementing DisposableBean	When custom cleanup logic is required
Calling destroyBean manually	When bean needs explicit termination
Custom Destruction Callbacks	When using third-party beans without modification
Using Cucumber Hooks	When cleanup is needed after each scenario in testing
Conclusion
If you need to destroy a single Spring bean, the best approach depends on your control over the bean:

Use @PreDestroy if you can modify the bean.
Manually remove the bean using destroySingleton() for on-demand removal.
Implement DisposableBean if you want Spring to handle cleanup.
Use a Cucumber hook for controlled cleanup after each scenario.
Register custom callbacks if working with third-party beans.

You said:
Added a profile cucumber in cucumberintegration but still the logs say clases a bean from test profole already exists
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you have added the @ActiveProfiles("cucumber") annotation in your CucumberIntegration test class but are still seeing logs indicating that a bean from the "test" profile is being loaded, it suggests that the test profile is being activated elsewhere.

Possible Causes and Solutions
1. Check If the "test" Profile Is Set as Default
Spring Boot might be activating the test profile by default. Check your application.properties or application.yml for a default profile setting.

Solution:
Ensure there is no default profile set in your application.properties (located in src/test/resources or src/main/resources):

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.profiles.active=test
If present, remove it or override it explicitly in the Cucumber test:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Alternatively, override it via system properties:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=cucumber
2. Confirm Profile Activation Order
Spring activates profiles in the following order of precedence:

System property (-Dspring.profiles.active=test)
application.properties or application.yml
Programmatic activation (e.g., SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles)
Test annotations (@ActiveProfiles)
Solution:
Ensure no other components in your application activate the test profile programmatically. You can override the profile explicitly in the test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.profiles.active=cucumber")
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
3. Use Profile-Specific Configuration Files
Even if you specify @ActiveProfiles("cucumber"), Spring loads the application-test.properties if it exists. To ensure only cucumber profile settings are used:

Solution:
Create an explicit application-cucumber.properties (or .yml) in src/test/resources:

properties
Copy
Edit
# application-cucumber.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:cucumberdb
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9095
4. Check if Another Test Class Uses the "test" Profile
If you have other test classes that explicitly use:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("test")
They could be triggering the "test" profile, and if the test context is shared, it might affect your Cucumber tests.

Solution:

Check your test package for any classes annotated with @ActiveProfiles("test").
Ensure tests are running in isolation by setting:
java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
5. Parallel Execution Causing Profile Conflicts
If tests run in parallel, multiple contexts with different profiles might be interfering with each other.

Solution:
Disable parallel execution by modifying your Maven Surefire Plugin:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Or run tests sequentially via:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
6. Verify Cucumber Step Definition Scanning
Ensure that your Cucumber test is not unintentionally scanning other test configurations.

Solution:
Explicitly set the packages to scan in @SpringBootTest:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = {CucumberSpringConfig.class}, properties = "spring.profiles.active=cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
7. Manually Set Profile Before Running Tests
You can explicitly set the active profile in a static block to ensure it's picked up before the context is loaded.

Solution:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {

    static {
        System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "cucumber");
    }

    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        System.out.println("Running with profile: " + System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active"));
    }
}
8. Enable Debug Logging to Verify Profile Activation
To investigate further, enable logging to confirm which profile is actually active during test execution.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
In the test logs, look for:

sql
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: cucumber
Summary of Solutions
Problem	Solution
Default test profile being set globally	Remove spring.profiles.active in properties
Test classes running in parallel	Run tests sequentially
Profile activation in multiple places	Override via @SpringBootTest
Profile-specific properties conflict	Use application-cucumber.properties
Incorrect context caching	Use @DirtiesContext to reset context
Conclusion
To ensure your Cucumber tests are using the correct profile (cucumber), follow these steps:

Remove spring.profiles.active=test from application.properties.
Add @SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.profiles.active=cucumber") in the test.
Ensure other test classes are not using conflicting profiles.
Run tests sequentially to avoid context sharing issues.
Enable debug logging to confirm active profiles.
If the issue persists, consider checking your test dependencies and lifecycle to ensure profiles are being set correctly.

But if i annotate controllers with test and cucumber with cucumber when tests run through maven clean install i want all tests to run
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to run all tests (both Cucumber and controller tests) during mvn clean install, while ensuring they run with their respective profiles (test for controller tests and cucumber for Cucumber tests), follow these best practices to ensure proper profile isolation and execution.

Solution Overview
To ensure both test types run correctly:

Set profiles individually per test class.
Ensure tests run sequentially to avoid context conflicts.
Use profile-specific configurations and property files.
Handle profile switching dynamically via Maven.
Step-by-Step Solution
1. Annotate Tests with Different Profiles
You should annotate the respective test classes with their appropriate profiles.

Controller Test (using test profile):

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {

    @Test
    public void testController() {
        System.out.println("Running with profile: " + System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active"));
    }
}
Cucumber Test (using cucumber profile):

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@CucumberContextConfiguration
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
2. Add Profile-Specific Configuration Files
Create separate application-test.properties and application-cucumber.properties under src/test/resources/:

application-test.properties (for controller tests):

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
logging.level.root=INFO
application-cucumber.properties (for Cucumber tests):

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:cucumberdb
logging.level.root=DEBUG
This ensures each test profile uses its respective configurations.

3. Ensure Tests Run in Isolation (Sequential Execution)
If both test types are modifying the context, ensure they don't interfere with each other by disabling parallel execution in Maven.

Modify your pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <parallel>none</parallel>
                <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
4. Use Maven Profiles to Control Execution
Instead of relying solely on @ActiveProfiles, you can use Maven profiles to dynamically set the profile during test execution.

Add this in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>controller-tests</id>
        <properties>
            <spring.profiles.active>test</spring.profiles.active>
        </properties>
    </profile>

    <profile>
        <id>cucumber-tests</id>
        <properties>
            <spring.profiles.active>cucumber</spring.profiles.active>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Now, you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Pcontroller-tests
mvn clean install -Pcucumber-tests
If you want both to run together:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Pcontroller-tests,cucumber-tests
5. Run Tests with Profile Switching Automatically
If you don't want to manually specify profiles via command-line arguments, you can configure the surefire plugin to run tests with different profiles automatically.

Modify your pom.xml to run tests with different profiles:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>run-controller-tests</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <spring.profiles.active>test</spring.profiles.active>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/ControllerTest.java</include>
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>run-cucumber-tests</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <spring.profiles.active>cucumber</spring.profiles.active>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/CucumberIntegrationTest.java</include>
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
Now simply run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
This setup ensures:

Controller tests run with the test profile.
Cucumber tests run with the cucumber profile.
6. Programmatic Profile Setting in Tests
If you want to dynamically set profiles at runtime within test classes, use a static initializer:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class DynamicProfileTest {

    static {
        if (System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active") == null) {
            System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "test");
        }
    }

    @Test
    public void testProfileSwitching() {
        System.out.println("Active profile: " + System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active"));
    }
}
7. Verify Profile Activation in Logs
Enable debug logging to confirm which profile is active in the tests.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
In the logs, look for:

sql
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: cucumber
8. Handling Context Cleanup with @DirtiesContext
If you find context conflicts between different test types, ensure cleanup after each test type:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
This forces the application context to be destroyed after Cucumber tests, preventing conflicts with controller tests.

Summary of Steps
Use @ActiveProfiles("test") and @ActiveProfiles("cucumber") appropriately in tests.
Create profile-specific configurations in application-test.properties and application-cucumber.properties.
Ensure sequential execution using Maven Surefire settings.
Leverage Maven profiles to run tests separately or together.
Use programmatic profile switching where required.
Enable logging to verify the profile used.
Handle context isolation using @DirtiesContext.
Conclusion
To ensure both test types (controller and cucumber) run correctly during mvn clean install:

Profile isolation should be handled via @ActiveProfiles, Maven properties, or environment variables.
Use maven-surefire-plugin to control profile switching.
Ensure proper context cleanup to prevent test interference.
By following the above strategies, you'll be able to run both tests without conflict, ensuring smooth CI/CD integration.

Let me know if you need further clarification or implementation guidance!

You said:
Shouldn't just setting two profiles test and cucumber with their own properties file be enough
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, setting two profiles (test and cucumber) with their own property files should generally be enough to run tests correctly, provided that the tests are properly annotated to activate the respective profiles and the Spring Boot profile loading mechanism works as expected.

However, there are a few important considerations to ensure proper profile management and avoid conflicts:

1. Correctly Defining Profile-Specific Property Files
Spring Boot automatically loads profile-specific property files if they follow the naming convention:

application-test.properties (for the test profile)
application-cucumber.properties (for the cucumber profile)
Ensure these files are placed in src/test/resources/, and contain the correct configurations.

Example file structure:

scss
Copy
Edit
src/test/resources/
├── application.properties  (optional, common settings)
├── application-test.properties
├── application-cucumber.properties
2. Proper Use of @ActiveProfiles in Test Classes
To make sure the appropriate profile is used in each test class, annotate your tests accordingly:

For Controller Tests (Using test Profile):
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {

    @Test
    public void testController() {
        System.out.println("Running with profile: " + System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active"));
    }
}
For Cucumber Tests (Using cucumber Profile):
java
Copy
Edit
@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {

    @Test
    public void cucumberTest() {
        System.out.println("Running with profile: " + System.getProperty("spring.profiles.active"));
    }
}
3. Ensure No Default Profile is Active
If spring.profiles.active is set in application.properties or system properties (e.g., in application-test.properties), it might override the @ActiveProfiles annotation.

Solution:
Make sure no conflicting settings exist in application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
# Do not set any default profile here to avoid conflicts
# spring.profiles.active=test  <-- REMOVE this line
4. Running Tests in Maven with Separate Profiles
Even with profile-specific property files, it's important to ensure that Maven runs the tests with the correct profile.

You can achieve this by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=cucumber
If you want both to run in a single command, define profiles in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>test-profile</id>
        <activation>
            <property>
                <name>spring.profiles.active</name>
                <value>test</value>
            </property>
        </activation>
    </profile>

    <profile>
        <id>cucumber-profile</id>
        <activation>
            <property>
                <name>spring.profiles.active</name>
                <value>cucumber</value>
            </property>
        </activation>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Now you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Ptest-profile,cucumber-profile
5. Logging Profile Activation for Debugging
Enable debug logs to confirm which profile is actually active during test execution:

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
Look for logs like:

sql
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: cucumber
6. Handling Context Refresh Between Tests
If both tests (controller and Cucumber) are running sequentially within the same Maven command, you might encounter context conflicts. Use @DirtiesContext in one of the test classes to force context refresh:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class ControllerTest {
}
7. Isolating Tests via Package Structure
Spring loads configurations based on package scanning. Ensure that your tests and their profiles are isolated correctly.

Example structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/test/java/com/example/controller/ControllerTest.java
src/test/java/com/example/cucumber/CucumberIntegrationTest.java
Spring Boot will pick up application-test.properties for the controller test and application-cucumber.properties for the Cucumber test as long as they are correctly annotated.

8. Test Configuration Verification
Ensure the profiles are being picked up correctly by writing a simple test to print the active profile:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class ProfileCheckTest {

    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    @Test
    public void checkActiveProfile() {
        System.out.println("Active profiles: " + String.join(",", environment.getActiveProfiles()));
    }
}
9. Possible Conflicts with Cucumber Glue Code
Ensure your CucumberOptions points to the correct glue package to avoid test class conflicts.

java
Copy
Edit
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions",
    plugin = {"pretty"}
)
public class CucumberTestRunner {
}
10. Running Tests in Parallel with Different Profiles
If running tests concurrently, set the forkCount in Maven to 1 to prevent profile conflicts:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <forkCount>1</forkCount>
        <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
Conclusion
Yes, using profile-specific property files (application-test.properties and application-cucumber.properties) should be sufficient, but to ensure successful execution of all tests via mvn clean install, follow these best practices:

Correct Test Annotations:

Use @ActiveProfiles("test") for controller tests.
Use @ActiveProfiles("cucumber") for Cucumber tests.
Profile-Specific Property Files:

Ensure correct properties in src/test/resources.
No Conflicting Default Profiles:

Remove spring.profiles.active from global properties.
Maven Profile Management:

Use -Dspring.profiles.active or define profiles in pom.xml.
Verify Active Profiles in Logs:

Enable debug logging to confirm profile usage.
Isolate Tests:

Run tests sequentially or in isolated environments using @DirtiesContext.
Run Tests Sequentially If Needed:

Avoid parallel execution conflicts.
By following these guidelines, you should be able to run all tests with their respective profiles in a clean and conflict-free way.

You said:
Shouldn't separate profile just make sure beans are not shared
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, separate profiles should ensure that beans are not shared, provided they are correctly configured and activated. Spring's profile mechanism is designed to load profile-specific beans and properties, isolating them from other profiles. However, in practical test execution, several factors can lead to unintended sharing of beans or context. Let's explore how profiles work and what might cause unintended sharing.

How Profiles Prevent Bean Sharing
Profile-Specific Bean Definitions:

Beans annotated with @Profile("test") or @Profile("cucumber") are only loaded when the corresponding profile is active.
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class TestConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myTestService() {
        return new MyService("test config");
    }
}

@Configuration
@Profile("cucumber")
public class CucumberConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myCucumberService() {
        return new MyService("cucumber config");
    }
}
Expected Behavior:

If test profile is active, only TestConfig beans will be loaded.
If cucumber profile is active, only CucumberConfig beans will be loaded.
Possible Reasons for Bean Sharing Despite Profiles
If beans are still being shared across test cases despite using different profiles, here are potential reasons why:

Spring Context Caching by Default:

Spring Boot caches the application context between test executions to optimize speed.
This means if one test loads the context with the test profile, it might be reused by a subsequent test that uses cucumber unless the context is explicitly marked dirty.
Solution:
Use @DirtiesContext to force context recreation:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class ControllerTest { }
Default Profile Activation:

If a default profile (like test) is set globally in application.properties or as a system property, it may override test-specific settings.
Solution:
Ensure no default profiles are set globally:

Check application.properties for:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.profiles.active=test
Override it in tests with:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.profiles.active=cucumber")
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
Tests Running in the Same JVM with Shared Context:

If tests are running sequentially without restarting the JVM, the same application context might persist across different tests.
Solution:

Ensure tests run in isolation by using:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
    <forkCount>1</forkCount>
</configuration>
This forces each test to run in its own process, ensuring complete separation of contexts.

Incorrect Annotation Placement:

If @ActiveProfiles is placed at the wrong level, it might not take effect properly.
Solution:
Ensure the profile annotation is correctly applied at the class level:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest { }
Test Configuration Components Overlapping:

Sometimes, common configurations might be loaded by both profiles unintentionally.
Solution:

Ensure that your common configurations are wrapped with an @Profile condition.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile({"test", "cucumber"})
public class CommonConfig {
    @Bean
    public CommonService commonService() {
        return new CommonService();
    }
}
Incorrect Use of @SpringBootTest and @WebMvcTest Together:

If some tests use @SpringBootTest (full context) while others use @WebMvcTest (controller slice), it might cause unintended context sharing.
Solution:

Use @SpringBootTest consistently to load the same set of beans per profile.
Missing Profile-Specific Properties Files:

If an application-test.properties exists but application-cucumber.properties is missing, Spring might fall back to using the default.
Solution:

Ensure both profiles have their respective configuration files:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/test/resources/application-test.properties
src/test/resources/application-cucumber.properties
Best Practices to Ensure Proper Profile Isolation
To guarantee that profiles don't share beans across tests:

Always use @ActiveProfiles in test classes:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest { }
Force a fresh context for critical tests using @DirtiesContext.

Run tests in isolated processes to avoid shared memory.
Add to pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<parallel>none</parallel>
<reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
Check logging to confirm correct profile activation.
Add in application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
Expected log output:

sql
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: cucumber
Ensure no default profiles are being set globally.
Remove any hardcoded spring.profiles.active in application properties.

Conclusion
Yes, separate profiles should isolate beans from being shared if:

The profiles are correctly activated with @ActiveProfiles.
Context caching is properly managed (via @DirtiesContext or sequential execution).
Profile-specific properties files are correctly set up.
No conflicting default profiles are overriding test-specific profiles.
Tests are run in isolated processes where necessary.
By following these best practices, you can ensure that your tests run in isolated environments with no unintended bean sharing.

You said:
Even than why was cucumber tests working fine and controller test too before introductoon of kafka
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Before the introduction of Kafka, your Cucumber tests and controller tests likely worked fine because:

No Long-Running Connections/Resources:

Kafka introduces persistent consumers and producers that maintain long-running connections to the broker, unlike other stateless components that can be easily destroyed and recreated.
Prior to Kafka, your application components might have been simple REST controllers and services that didn't require persistent connections, leading to smooth context handling and test isolation.
Spring Context Was Lightweight and Easier to Manage:

Without Kafka, the application context was likely faster to start and shut down.
Kafka introduces additional complexity by adding background threads and network dependencies, which might lead to context caching or improper shutdowns.
No External Dependencies Requiring Explicit Cleanup:

REST controllers and services are usually stateless, meaning they don't require explicit cleanup. Kafka consumers and producers, on the other hand, need proper lifecycle management to avoid conflicts between test runs.
Lack of Persistent Connections Across Test Runs:

Previously, your tests might have been completely isolated and stateless.
Kafka components, especially consumers, tend to keep polling topics even when the application context is supposed to be shut down, leading to context persistence.
Spring Test Caching Didn't Cause Issues:

Before Kafka, the cached Spring context wouldn't have contained resource-intensive beans. Kafka clients, however, can continue running in the background even after tests finish, which can lead to port conflicts or resource leakage.
Why Kafka Might Be Causing Issues Now
Once Kafka was introduced, the following problems likely started occurring:

1. Embedded Kafka Lifecycle Not Properly Managed
If the embedded Kafka broker isn't shut down after the tests, the controller tests might attempt to reconnect to an already shut-down broker.
Kafka clients (consumers/producers) may continue running in background threads, interfering with subsequent test cases.
Solution: Ensure Kafka is properly destroyed after each test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    System.out.println("Kafka broker shut down.");
}
2. Context Not Being Properly Destroyed Between Tests
Kafka components are initialized within the Spring application context and, if not properly shut down, might cause duplicate bean definitions or stale connections.
Solution: Use @DirtiesContext on test classes that use Kafka:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class KafkaTest {
}
3. Parallel Execution of Tests Causing Port Conflicts
Kafka might be running in the background when another test tries to start, leading to "bean already exists" or "port in use" issues.
Solution: Disable test parallelism in Maven:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
4. Profiles Might Be Interfering with Each Other
The introduction of Kafka may have led to shared beans across profiles (test and cucumber), where Kafka consumers and producers might be leaking across tests.
Solution: Explicitly separate profiles and verify correct usage:

java
Copy
Edit
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@SpringBootTest
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Ensure profile-specific property files exist:

application-test.properties
application-cucumber.properties
5. Kafka Consumer/Producer Threads Not Stopping
Kafka consumers may keep polling topics even when the application context shuts down, leading to errors in the next test run.
Solution: Explicitly shut down Kafka consumers and producers using @PreDestroy or manual cleanup:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class KafkaConsumerService {

    private final KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer;

    public KafkaConsumerService(KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer) {
        this.consumer = consumer;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void stopConsumer() {
        System.out.println("Stopping Kafka consumer...");
        consumer.wakeup();  // Graceful exit
    }
}
6. Embedded Kafka and External Kafka Conflicts
If you're using an external Kafka instance for some tests and embedded Kafka for others, they might interfere with each other.

Solution: Ensure embedded Kafka runs only when needed:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestPropertySource(properties = "spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=${spring.embedded.kafka.brokers}")
How to Fix the Issue
To ensure smooth test execution after introducing Kafka:

Proper Profile Management:

Ensure Cucumber tests activate the correct profile (cucumber) and controller tests use test.
Ensure property files exist for each profile.
Ensure Kafka Cleanup:

Use @PreDestroy to stop Kafka consumers and producers.
Use embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy() to clean up after tests.
Disable Test Parallel Execution:

Run tests sequentially to avoid port conflicts.
Force Spring Context Reload:

Add @DirtiesContext to tests that require Kafka.
Enable Debug Logging for Better Diagnosis:

Add logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG to track profile and bean initialization.
Conclusion
Before Kafka:
Tests worked fine because the context was simpler, lightweight, and stateless, without long-running connections.

After Kafka:
Issues likely arose due to persistent connections, improper shutdown, and profile conflicts.

By following the solutions mentioned above, you should be able to restore proper test isolation and ensure smooth test execution.

To add the following configuration in your pom.xml for sequential test execution, follow these steps:

Step 1: Add Configuration to Maven Surefire Plugin
The <configuration> section should be placed inside the maven-surefire-plugin (for unit tests) and/or maven-failsafe-plugin (for integration tests).

Example Configuration for maven-surefire-plugin:

Options include:
none: No parallel execution (default behavior).
methods: Run test methods in parallel.
classes: Run test classes in parallel.
both: Run both methods and classes in parallel.
<reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
Prevents Maven from reusing JVM forks, forcing a fresh JVM instance for each test run.
This helps to avoid state leakage between tests and ensures proper cleanup.

Step 3: Running the Tests with Maven
Once you've added the configuration, run your tests using:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test
For integration tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean verify
Step 4: Additional Considerations
Running with Debug Output:
To verify that tests are running sequentially, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -X
Override Configuration via Command Line:
You can also enforce sequential execution at runtime without modifying pom.xml:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dsurefire.parallel=none -Dsurefire.reuseForks=false
Checking Logs for Parallel Execution:
You can verify parallel execution settings by looking at the test logs:

sql
Copy
Edit
Running tests sequentially...
Conclusion
To disable parallel execution and ensure tests run sequentially:

Add the <configuration> section inside the maven-surefire-plugin or maven-failsafe-plugin in pom.xml.
Run tests with mvn clean test.
Use -X to verify if parallel execution is disabled.

How to remove a bean from context and all its dependencies 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To remove a bean from the Spring application context along with its dependencies, you need to consider the following approaches:

1. Manually Removing a Bean Using ConfigurableApplicationContext
If you have access to the application context, you can remove a bean programmatically.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BeanRemovalService {

    private final ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    public BeanRemovalService(ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public void removeBean(String beanName) {
        ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory = context.getBeanFactory();
        if (beanFactory.containsBean(beanName)) {
            beanFactory.destroySingleton(beanName);
            System.out.println("Bean '" + beanName + "' removed from the context.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Bean '" + beanName + "' does not exist in the context.");
        }
    }
}
Steps:

Check if the bean exists in the context.
Call destroySingleton(beanName) to remove it.
Dependencies will not be automatically removed unless they are part of the bean itself.
Note: This method works only for singleton beans, and dependencies injected into the bean will not be explicitly removed unless the beans are tightly coupled.

2. Removing Bean and Its Dependencies Using Context Refresh
If you need to remove a bean and all its dependencies, the safest way is to refresh the application context.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ContextRefreshService {

    private final ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    public ContextRefreshService(ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public void restartContext() {
        context.close();
        context.refresh();
        System.out.println("Spring application context refreshed.");
    }
}
Explanation:

This approach completely reloads the application context, removing all beans and recreating only those defined in the configuration.
3. Using @Scope("prototype") to Avoid Persistent Dependencies
If you want to ensure beans can be discarded and their dependencies aren't retained, define them as prototype scoped.

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
What happens:

Prototype beans are not managed after creation, so once removed from the context, they are eligible for garbage collection.
4. Manually Destroying a Bean's Dependencies
If a bean has dependencies, removing it from the context won't automatically remove its dependencies. You can manually destroy them by using destroyBean().

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;

@Component
public class BeanDependencyCleanupService {

    private final ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    public BeanDependencyCleanupService(ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public void removeBeanWithDependencies(String beanName) {
        ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory = context.getBeanFactory();
        if (beanFactory.containsBean(beanName)) {
            Object bean = beanFactory.getBean(beanName);
            beanFactory.destroyBean(bean);
            beanFactory.destroySingleton(beanName);
            System.out.println("Bean and its dependencies removed.");
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

destroyBean() will call the bean's cleanup method (@PreDestroy).
destroySingleton() removes it from the Spring context.
5. Using DisposableBean Interface to Handle Bean Destruction
If you want the bean to clean up its dependencies when removed, implement the DisposableBean interface.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean implements DisposableBean {

    private final MyDependency myDependency;

    public MyBean(MyDependency myDependency) {
        this.myDependency = myDependency;
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying MyBean and its dependencies...");
        myDependency.cleanup();
    }
}
What Happens:

When the bean is removed from the context, the destroy() method will be called to release its dependencies.
6. Conditional Bean Removal Based on Environment or Profile
You can conditionally load or remove beans based on active profiles.

Example using profiles:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!test")
public class MyBeanConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
What Happens:

When the profile test is active, the bean will not be loaded.
7. Removing Bean Definitions Dynamically
If a bean was registered using registerSingleton(), it can be removed using:

java
Copy
Edit
ConfigurableListableBeanFactory factory = context.getBeanFactory();
factory.destroySingleton("myBeanName");
If the bean was defined using XML or Java config, you can deregister it as follows:

java
Copy
Edit
ConfigurableListableBeanFactory factory = context.getBeanFactory();
factory.removeBeanDefinition("myBeanName");
Important: This works only for beans that were registered programmatically.

8. Handling Dependency Removal with @PreDestroy
Ensure dependent beans are cleaned up when the parent bean is destroyed by marking dependencies with @PreDestroy.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyDependency {

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up MyDependency...");
    }
}
9. Using Lazy Initialization to Prevent Early Loading
Mark beans as @Lazy so they are initialized only when needed, reducing memory usage and potential stale references.

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@Lazy
public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
What Happens:

The bean won't be initialized until accessed.
10. Restarting the Application to Fully Clear Context
If none of the above solutions work, sometimes restarting the Spring Boot application is the best way to guarantee full cleanup of all beans and dependencies.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
        context.close();
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
Summary of Methods to Remove a Bean and Its Dependencies
Approach	Description	Suitable for
destroySingleton()	Removes a singleton bean from the context	Simple bean removal
destroyBean()	Calls cleanup methods before removal	Beans with dependencies
Context refresh()	Completely resets the application context	Full context reset
@PreDestroy + DisposableBean	Handles cleanup inside the bean itself	Self-contained cleanup
Profile-based exclusion	Conditionally loads/removes beans	Environment-based removal
Manual dependency cleanup	Manually remove bean dependencies	Complex dependency trees
Conclusion
If you want to remove a single bean from the context, use destroySingleton().
If you want to remove a bean and clean up dependencies, implement DisposableBean or use destroyBean().
If you need a full reset, consider refreshing the context or restarting the application.
Profile-based management can help control which beans are loaded in different environments.

Anyway to run cucumber integrationtests after all tests have run
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can run Cucumber integration tests after all other tests have completed using different approaches depending on your testing strategy and build tools. Below are several ways to achieve this in a Spring Boot + Cucumber + Maven setup.

1. Using Maven Failsafe Plugin (Best Approach)
The maven-failsafe-plugin is designed to run integration tests separately from unit tests and execute them after unit tests have completed.

Steps to Implement:
Rename your Cucumber test runner class to follow the pattern *IT.java (e.g., CucumberIntegrationIT.java).
Configure Maven to run unit tests with maven-surefire-plugin and Cucumber integration tests with maven-failsafe-plugin.
Example in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Unit tests using Surefire plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <configuration>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*Test.java</include>
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>

        <!-- Integration tests (Cucumber) using Failsafe plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>integration-test</goal>
                        <goal>verify</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*IT.java</include>
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
How It Works:
During the test phase, Surefire will run unit tests (*Test.java).
During the integration-test phase, Failsafe will run Cucumber tests (*IT.java).
The verify goal ensures integration tests are validated after completion.
Command to Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean verify
2. Using Maven Profiles to Separate Tests
You can define a Maven profile to execute Cucumber tests only after all other tests have completed.

Example pom.xml Profile:
xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>cucumber-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/CucumberIntegrationTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Run All Tests Sequentially:
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test && mvn test -Pcucumber-tests
3. Using JUnit @AfterAll Hook to Trigger Cucumber Tests Manually
If you want to manually run Cucumber tests after all JUnit tests have completed, you can use JUnit’s lifecycle management.

Example using JUnit 5:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import io.cucumber.core.cli.Main;

public class TestRunner {

    @Test
    public void unitTests() {
        System.out.println("Running unit tests...");
        // Run unit test assertions
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void runCucumberTests() {
        System.out.println("Running Cucumber integration tests...");
        String[] argv = new String[]{
                "-g", "com.example.stepdefinitions",
                "src/test/resources/features"
        };
        Main.main(argv);
    }
}
Explanation:
This JUnit class runs all unit tests first.
After the tests complete, it calls Cucumber.main() to execute feature files.
4. Using Test Execution Order in JUnit
If you are using JUnit 5, you can set test execution order to ensure that unit tests run first, followed by Cucumber tests.

Example using @TestMethodOrder:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Order;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestMethodOrder;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.MethodOrderer;

@TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)
public class OrderedTestRunner {

    @Test
    @Order(1)
    public void runUnitTests() {
        System.out.println("Running unit tests first...");
    }

    @Test
    @Order(2)
    public void runCucumberTests() {
        System.out.println("Running Cucumber tests after...");
        String[] args = new String[]{
                "-g", "com.example.stepdefinitions",
                "src/test/resources/features"
        };
        io.cucumber.core.cli.Main.main(args);
    }
}
Explanation:
The test methods will run in the specified order.
Unit tests run first, then Cucumber tests.
5. Using an External Shell Script
You can also control the test execution order using a shell script.

Example run_tests.sh:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running unit tests..."
mvn clean test

echo "Running Cucumber integration tests..."
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features"
Run Script:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
6. Running Cucumber Tests After All Tests Using a Test Listener
You can use Spring's TestExecutionListener to hook into test execution and run Cucumber after all other tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.test.context.TestContext;
import org.springframework.test.context.support.AbstractTestExecutionListener;
import io.cucumber.core.cli.Main;

public class CucumberTestExecutionListener extends AbstractTestExecutionListener {

    @Override
    public void afterTestClass(TestContext testContext) {
        System.out.println("Running Cucumber tests after all unit tests...");
        Main.main(new String[]{
                "-g", "com.example.stepdefinitions",
                "src/test/resources/features"
        });
    }
}
Register the listener in your test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@TestExecutionListeners(CucumberTestExecutionListener.class)
public class MyTestClass {
}
7. Using Build Tool to Chain Test Execution
Instead of relying on Spring, you can leverage a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.) to first run unit tests and then trigger Cucumber integration tests.

Example Jenkins Pipeline:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean test'
            }
        }
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn verify -Pintegration-tests'
            }
        }
    }
}
Conclusion: Recommended Approach
If you are using Maven:

The maven-failsafe-plugin is the best approach, as it is specifically designed to run integration tests after unit tests.
Use the naming convention *IT.java for Cucumber tests.
If you are using JUnit:

Use @AfterAll to trigger Cucumber tests after unit tests finish.
If you prefer script-based control:

Use shell scripts to sequentially run unit and integration tests.

You said:
Although i have added cucumber and test profiles maven clean install shows only activating profile [test]
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your mvn clean install command is only activating the test profile despite adding both cucumber and test profiles, it suggests that:

The test profile is being activated by default.
The cucumber profile is not being explicitly activated in the build process.
Profile activation settings might be overridden or misconfigured.
Steps to Fix and Ensure Both Profiles Are Activated
1. Verify spring.profiles.active in Configuration Files
Check your application.properties or application.yml files located in src/main/resources or src/test/resources.

Example (src/test/resources/application.properties)

properties
Copy
Edit
# Remove any hardcoded profile like below if it exists
spring.profiles.active=test
Instead, change it to:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.profiles.active=test,cucumber
If you want to control it dynamically, leave it blank and rely on Maven activation.

2. Activate Profiles via Maven Command Line
When running mvn clean install, you can activate multiple profiles manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber
This ensures that both test and cucumber profiles are activated together.

3. Define Profile-Specific Property Files
Make sure you have separate property files for each profile in src/test/resources:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/test/resources/
├── application-test.properties
├── application-cucumber.properties
This will allow Spring to load the correct configurations when the respective profile is active.

4. Add Profile Activation in pom.xml
If you want Maven to automatically activate both profiles, add them to the <profiles> section in pom.xml.

Example:

xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>test-profile</id>
        <activation>
            <property>
                <name>spring.profiles.active</name>
                <value>test</value>
            </property>
        </activation>
    </profile>

    <profile>
        <id>cucumber-profile</id>
        <activation>
            <property>
                <name>spring.profiles.active</name>
                <value>cucumber</value>
            </property>
        </activation>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Run Maven with both profiles:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Ptest-profile,cucumber-profile
5. Use @ActiveProfiles in Test Classes
Ensure that your test classes are correctly annotated with the right profiles.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles({"test", "cucumber"})
public class MyCucumberTest {
}
6. Add Profile-Specific Properties in pom.xml
You can specify profile-based property activation in the Maven pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<properties>
    <spring.profiles.active>${spring.profiles.active}</spring.profiles.active>
</properties>
Then run the tests with:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber
7. Use System Property to Set Profiles
If your build environment allows, set the system property in the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable:

bash
Copy
Edit
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber"
mvn clean install
Or use it in Windows:

powershell
Copy
Edit
set MAVEN_OPTS=-Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber
mvn clean install
8. Log Profile Activation for Debugging
Enable Spring Boot logging to confirm which profiles are being activated:

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
When running the tests, check the logs for lines like:

bash
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: test, cucumber
9. Ensure No Conflicts in Test Framework
If using JUnit and Cucumber together, ensure that profiles are properly set for both test runners and that no other configurations are overriding them.

Conclusion and Next Steps
To ensure both test and cucumber profiles are activated during mvn clean install:

Check and modify application.properties to avoid hardcoded values.
Explicitly activate profiles via command line:
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber
Define Maven profiles in pom.xml to automatically activate the needed profiles.
Ensure correct annotations (@ActiveProfiles) in test classes.
Enable logging to confirm active profiles.
After making these changes, try running:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=test,cucumber

You said:
Even when context is closed in cucumber afterall threshold (1) error comes
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're encountering a threshold(1) error even after closing the Spring application context in Cucumber's @AfterAll method, it likely indicates that some beans, resources, or background processes (such as Kafka consumers, producers, or threads) are still running or trying to access the context after it has been closed.

Possible Causes of the Threshold(1) Error:
Kafka Consumers/Producers Not Properly Closed:

Kafka components might still be polling even after context shutdown.
Threads or Executors Still Running:

Some background threads initiated by beans may still be active.
Context Cached by Spring:

Spring might not fully dispose of the application context due to caching.
Non-Spring Managed Components:

Some components might have been manually created outside of Spring’s lifecycle, causing unexpected behavior.
Steps to Fix the Issue
1. Properly Stop Kafka Consumers and Producers
Make sure all Kafka consumers and producers are explicitly closed before shutting down the context.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class KafkaConsumerService {

    private final Consumer<String, String> consumer;

    public KafkaConsumerService(Consumer<String, String> consumer) {
        this.consumer = consumer;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void stopConsumer() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down Kafka consumer...");
        consumer.wakeup();  // Ensures graceful shutdown
    }
}
In your test teardown step:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanup(@Autowired KafkaConsumerService kafkaService) {
    kafkaService.stopConsumer();
}
2. Forcefully Shut Down Spring Application Context
Instead of relying on @AfterAll, manually ensure that the Spring context is closed.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownContext(CucumberTest testInstance) {
    if (testInstance.context.isActive()) {
        testInstance.context.close();
        System.out.println("Spring application context forcefully closed.");
    }
}
Ensure proper destruction of all beans:

java
Copy
Edit
@PreDestroy
public void cleanupResources() {
    System.out.println("Cleaning up resources...");
    // Close database connections, thread pools, etc.
}
3. Use @DirtiesContext to Force Cleanup
If the context is being shared between tests, add @DirtiesContext to ensure that it is properly reset after each test run.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
4. Investigate Background Threads and Scheduled Tasks
Check if any scheduled tasks or background threads are still running.

If you have @Scheduled tasks, disable them during tests:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.task.scheduling.enabled=false
Use a shutdown hook to track threads:

java
Copy
Edit
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Application shutting down...")));
5. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Interference
If multiple tests are running in parallel, they might be interfering with each other.

Modify pom.xml to disable parallel execution:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Or run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
6. Enable Logging to Trace Resource Leaks
Enable debug logging to see if any beans, threads, or resources are lingering after shutdown.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
Look for logs like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Bean not properly destroyed: myKafkaConsumer
Thread still running: myThreadPoolExecutor
7. Manually Shut Down Embedded Kafka
If using Embedded Kafka, make sure it is properly destroyed.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
    }
}
8. Ensure Tests Are Not Sharing Application State
Make sure tests are running in complete isolation:

Separate configurations for Cucumber and other tests.

Isolate configurations with profiles:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest {
}
9. Check for Non-Spring Managed Resources
If there are manually created resources outside Spring’s context (e.g., database connections, executor services), ensure they are closed.

java
Copy
Edit
private static ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownExecutors() {
    executorService.shutdown();
}
Conclusion and Suggested Fixes
To resolve the threshold(1) error:

Ensure proper shutdown of Kafka consumers/producers.
Explicitly close the Spring context using ConfigurableApplicationContext.close().
Use @DirtiesContext to force context refresh.
Run tests sequentially to avoid shared state issues.
Check for lingering background tasks or non-Spring managed components.
Enable debug logging to trace context closure issues.

How to collects all the logs from maven clean install when its run through intellij
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To collect all logs from running mvn clean install in IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the following methods to capture the logs efficiently.

1. Redirect Output to a File (Command-Line Approach)
If you are running the command via IntelliJ's terminal, you can redirect the output to a file.

Steps:
Open the Terminal in IntelliJ (View > Tool Windows > Terminal).

Run the following command to capture logs in a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install > build_logs.txt 2>&1
> Redirects standard output (stdout) to build_logs.txt
2>&1 Redirects standard error (stderr) to the same file.
View the logs by opening build_logs.txt inside IntelliJ.

2. Save IntelliJ Maven Console Logs
If you're running the Maven command inside IntelliJ's Maven Tool Window, you can manually save the output.

Steps:
Run your tests using:

Open "Maven" tool window (View > Tool Windows > Maven).
Expand your project and select clean install goal.
Click Run.
Once the build completes, click inside the "Run" window (bottom panel).

Right-click in the Maven console output and choose "Save to File".

Choose a file location (e.g., mvn_build_logs.txt).

3. Configure Maven to Write Logs to a File Automatically
You can configure Maven to always generate logs in a file without manually redirecting output.

Steps:
Add the following to your project's pom.xml inside the <build> section:

xml
Copy
Edit
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>run</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <target>
                            <echo message="Saving Maven logs to file" />
                            <redirector output="target/maven-build.log" append="false" />
                        </target>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
Run the build:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
Check the logs in target/maven-build.log.

4. Use Maven Logging Options
You can run Maven with verbose logging enabled and output it to a file.

Steps:
Run the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -X > detailed_logs.txt 2>&1
The -X flag enables debug-level logging, capturing all details.

5. Customize IntelliJ Build Logging Settings
You can configure IntelliJ to show logs in more detail and persist them.

Steps:
Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
In the "Output Level", select Debug or Verbose.
Run clean install again and copy the logs.
6. Use a Logging Plugin for More Control
You can use the Maven Logging extension to log build details to a file.

Add this to your pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.3.0</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>install</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>single</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install | tee mvn_logs.txt
7. Use IntelliJ Build Tool Logging (Automatic Logs Collection)
If you are using IntelliJ's "Build" tool window, logs are automatically saved.

Steps:
Run mvn clean install using IntelliJ's Run/Debug configuration.
Go to View > Tool Windows > Build.
Click the "Export Logs" button at the top-right to save the logs.
8. Environment Variable for Logging (Persistent Logging)
You can add an environment variable to always log Maven output:

Linux/macOS:
bash
Copy
Edit
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.logging=debug -Dmaven.logging.level=DEBUG"
Windows (PowerShell):
powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.logging=debug -Dmaven.logging.level=DEBUG"
Now run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install > build_logs.txt 2>&1
Conclusion: Best Approach Based on Your Needs
Requirement	Recommended Solution
Quick log capture	Redirect output mvn clean install > logs.txt
Automatic logging	Configure Maven logging in pom.xml
IntelliJ logs saving manually	Right-click Maven output > Save to file
Detailed debugging logs	Run with -X flag
Long-term logging strategy	Use environment variables for logging
Try one of the above methods and let me know if you need more guidance!

You said:
Tried all solution but controller tests annotated with @springboottests still fail saying ce bean already present
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your controller tests annotated with @SpringBootTest still fail with an error stating that a bean is already present, even after trying various solutions, it suggests that:

Spring application context is not properly reset, causing bean conflicts across test classes.
Cucumber tests may not be properly shutting down all beans, leading to overlapping definitions when the controller tests run.
Context caching by Spring Test framework might be causing issues.
Incorrect profile/application context overlap between tests.
Step-by-Step Debugging and Solutions
1. Use @DirtiesContext in Tests to Force Context Reset
Even if you close the application context in Cucumber tests, Spring might still be caching it. Try adding @DirtiesContext to force a fresh context for your controller tests.

Example for Controller Tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class ControllerTest {
    // Your tests here
}
Alternatively, apply @DirtiesContext globally for Cucumber tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Why?

Forces Spring to destroy and recreate the application context after the test class.
2. Check for Bean Overlapping in Configurations
Verify if any beans are being redefined across different test configurations.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class CommonTestConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
If the same bean is being defined in both test and cucumber contexts, ensure they are properly isolated using @Profile.

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class TestConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Ensure your test classes are using the right profile:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest { }
3. Use Separate Test Profiles for Different Test Types
If both Cucumber and controller tests are sharing the same test profile, it's possible they are loading overlapping beans. Ensure each test type has its own profile.

Example:

application-test.properties
application-cucumber.properties
Modify your test classes to specify the correct profile:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest { }

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest { }
4. Run Tests Sequentially (Avoid Parallel Execution Issues)
If tests are running in parallel, they may be interfering with each other, leading to bean duplication.

Solution in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Run tests sequentially:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
5. Close Spring Context Programmatically in Cucumber Tests
If beans persist after Cucumber tests, manually close the context to ensure it's cleaned up before the next test starts.

Example in Cucumber Hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CucumberHooks {

    private final ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    public CucumberHooks(ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown(CucumberHooks hooks) {
        if (hooks.context.isActive()) {
            hooks.context.close();
            System.out.println("Spring application context closed after Cucumber tests.");
        }
    }
}
6. Verify Embedded Kafka Shutdown
If your application uses Embedded Kafka, it may not be properly shutting down, leading to port conflicts or bean persistence.

Ensure you shut it down after tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
}
7. Avoid Context Caching by Using a Custom Test Suite
Instead of running all tests at once, divide them into separate test suites.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({
    ControllerTest.class,
    CucumberIntegrationTest.class
})
public class AllTestsSuite {
}
Run it separately instead of mvn clean install to avoid context conflicts.

8. Verify Bean Scanning Scope
Make sure your test beans are not scanned globally by limiting component scanning.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.controllers")
public class ControllerTest { }
If you have global scans, they might be loading beans unnecessarily.

9. Inspect Logs for Bean Overlaps
Enable debug logging to inspect which beans are being duplicated.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Look for log messages like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Bean 'myBean' is already defined in the application context.
10. Reset Environment Between Tests
If tests depend on environment variables, reset them before each test.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterEach
void resetEnv() {
    System.clearProperty("spring.profiles.active");
}
Final Recommended Approach to Try
Apply @DirtiesContext to force new context creation.
Use separate profiles for Cucumber and Controller tests.
Manually close Spring context in Cucumber tests using hooks.
Ensure Embedded Kafka is fully stopped before controller tests.
Run tests sequentially using Maven Surefire settings.
Inspect logs for bean duplication issues.
Conclusion
If you're still facing the "bean already present" issue even after closing the context, it is likely due to:

Context caching or improper shutdown.
Profile misconfiguration leading to shared beans.
Background processes (like Kafka) still running.
Following the recommended solutions should help isolate and resolve the issue. Let me know if you need further assistance!

You said:
Is this possible to not load beans from a package when cucumber tests run
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible to prevent beans from being loaded from specific packages when running Cucumber tests, ensuring they are excluded from the Spring application context. Here are several ways to achieve this:

1. Using @ComponentScan with Package Exclusion
You can customize the component scanning by explicitly excluding specific packages in your Cucumber test configuration.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example", excludeFilters = {
    @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASPECTJ, pattern = "com.example.excludedpackage..*")
})
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Explanation:

The excludeFilters ensures that beans from com.example.excludedpackage are not loaded into the context.
You can also use FilterType.REGEX for regular expression-based exclusions.
2. Using Custom Spring Configuration for Cucumber
Instead of scanning the entire application, define a test-specific configuration for Cucumber.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {
    "com.example.service", // Include only required packages
    "com.example.repository"
})
public class CucumberTestConfig {
}
In your Cucumber test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = CucumberTestConfig.class)
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest {
}
Explanation:

This will load only beans from the specified packages and exclude everything else.
3. Using Spring Boot Property Exclusions
If your project is modularized with auto-configuration, you can exclude beans via application-cucumber.properties:

Example (src/test/resources/application-cucumber.properties):

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.autoconfigure.exclude=com.example.excludedpackage.MyExcludedService
Explanation:

This property tells Spring Boot to skip specific beans during the test execution.
4. Using @MockBean to Override Beans
If certain beans should not be initialized in Cucumber tests, mock them instead to avoid their instantiation.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest {

    @MockBean
    private MyExcludedService myExcludedService;  // Prevent real bean from loading

}
Explanation:

The @MockBean will replace the actual bean with a mock, effectively preventing initialization.
5. Using @Import to Control Loaded Beans
Instead of scanning all beans, you can specify only the required configurations by using @Import.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@Import({RequiredConfig.class})  // Import only specific configs, excluding others
public class CucumberTest {
}
Explanation:

This loads only the configurations you specify and excludes everything else.
6. Conditional Bean Loading Using Profiles
Mark beans that should not be loaded during Cucumber tests using Spring’s profile feature.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!cucumber")  // This bean will NOT load if 'cucumber' profile is active
public class ExcludedBeanConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public MyExcludedService excludedService() {
        return new MyExcludedService();
    }
}
Explanation:

This ensures the bean is excluded when the Cucumber profile is active.
7. Using @ConditionalOnProperty to Disable Beans
Define beans to be conditionally loaded based on a property in your Cucumber test properties.

Example Bean Configuration:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class ConditionalBeanConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.load.excluded", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
    public MyExcludedService myExcludedService() {
        return new MyExcludedService();
    }
}
Disable the Bean in application-cucumber.properties:
properties
Copy
Edit
feature.load.excluded=false
8. Use Custom Profiles for Bean Exclusion
Create a custom profile for Cucumber tests and use it to exclude certain configurations.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!cucumber")  // Beans won't load if 'cucumber' is active
public class MyExcludedBeansConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyExcludedService excludedService() {
        return new MyExcludedService();
    }
}
Set Profile in Cucumber Test Class:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest { }
9. Using @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {...})
If the unwanted beans are being auto-configured, exclude them at test runtime.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {MyExcludedService.class, AnotherExcludedService.class})
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest { }
10. Using SpringBootTest with Selective Context Initialization
Instead of loading the entire context, limit it by specifying only required parts.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE, classes = {SomeSpecificConfig.class})
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest { }
Explanation:

This approach ensures only the required configuration is loaded, preventing unnecessary beans.
Conclusion: Best Approaches Based on Needs
Scenario	Recommended Approach
Exclude entire package	Use @ComponentScan(excludeFilters = {...})
Prevent specific beans	Use @Profile("!cucumber") or @ConditionalOnProperty
Prevent auto-configured beans	Use @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {...})
Load only necessary configurations	Use @Import({Config.class})
Override unwanted beans	Use @MockBean
Recommended Approach for Your Case
If you want to exclude all beans from a specific package, the best solution is:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example", excludeFilters = {
    @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.REGEX, pattern = "com\\.example\\.excludedpackage\\..*")
})
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberIntegrationTest { }
Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

You said:
The question still remains why only controller tests have a problem
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The reason why only the controller tests are failing with the error stating a bean is already present, even after handling the Spring application context in Cucumber tests, could be due to several factors specific to the nature of controller tests and how they interact with the application context. Let's analyze the possible reasons and solutions:

1. Context Caching and Reuse in Controller Tests
Why? Spring caches the application context to optimize test performance. If the context is not correctly refreshed between test classes, it can cause duplicate bean errors.
Possible Cause: The controller tests might be running after the Cucumber tests, attempting to reuse an existing (possibly altered) context from the previous test run.
Solution: Force Spring to reload a fresh context before running controller tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.BEFORE_CLASS)
public class ControllerTest {
}
2. Differences in Bean Initialization Order
Why? Controller tests usually start the full application context, including web layers, which might behave differently compared to Cucumber tests.
Possible Cause: Some beans might be initialized in Cucumber tests earlier and stay in memory, causing conflicts when controller tests try to re-initialize them.
Solution:
Isolate the web layer using @WebMvcTest instead of @SpringBootTest for controller tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(controllers = MyController.class)
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
This way, only web-related components are loaded, reducing conflicts.

3. Embedded Kafka Not Properly Shut Down
Why? Kafka consumers and producers may continue running after the Cucumber tests finish.
Possible Cause: Controller tests attempt to restart Kafka-related beans, which might still be running in the background.
Solution: Ensure that Kafka is properly shut down before controller tests run:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
        System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
    }
}
Alternatively, use @DirtiesContext to force cleanup.

4. Spring Boot Test Application Context Differences
Why? @SpringBootTest loads the full application context, whereas Cucumber tests might load only part of it.
Possible Cause: The controller tests might be loading additional beans that were not properly shut down in previous tests.
Solution:
Use test slicing to load only what's necessary for the controller tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
5. Conflicting Bean Definitions in test and cucumber Profiles
Why? If both profiles are activated during mvn clean install, conflicting beans might be loaded.
Possible Cause: Beans defined in application-test.properties and application-cucumber.properties might have overlapping or conflicting definitions.
Solution:

Ensure the correct profile is used in the controller tests:
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
Check profile logs to confirm the correct profile is applied:
In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.core.env=DEBUG
Look for logs like:

bash
Copy
Edit
The following profiles are active: test
6. Improper Cleanup of Beans Created in Cucumber Tests
Why? If beans are created in Cucumber tests and are not properly destroyed, they may remain in the application context when the controller tests start.
Possible Cause: Spring beans might have dependencies that persist across different tests.
Solution:
Manually clean up the beans created in Cucumber tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanup(ApplicationContext context) {
    ((ConfigurableApplicationContext) context).close();
}
7. Beans Automatically Loaded via Component Scanning
Why? If component scanning is enabled broadly, beans from Cucumber test packages might be included in the controller test context.
Possible Cause: Packages scanned in @SpringBootApplication might overlap with Cucumber tests.
Solution:
Explicitly specify the packages to scan in controller tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.controllers")
public class ControllerTest {
}
8. Dependencies Persisting in Static Contexts
Why? If any dependencies are declared as static in the Cucumber tests, they might persist across test executions.
Possible Cause: Static fields or singletons might be holding references to beans that interfere with the controller tests.
Solution:

Review Cucumber step definition classes for static fields.
Reset static fields manually in Cucumber hooks:
java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void resetStaticFields() {
    SomeStaticClass.clear();
}
9. Maven Test Execution Order
Why? If Maven is running tests in a non-deterministic order, Cucumber tests might interfere with controller tests.
Possible Cause: Parallel execution might lead to shared application state.
Solution:
Run tests sequentially using Maven settings:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
10. Checking for Multiple Application Contexts
Why? Multiple test classes using @SpringBootTest can create multiple instances of the application context.
Possible Cause: Tests might not be sharing the context properly.
Solution:
Add the following in CucumberIntegrationTest to close the context explicitly:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void tearDown(CucumberIntegrationTest testInstance) {
    testInstance.context.close();
}
Conclusion: Steps to Resolve the Issue
Use @DirtiesContext in Controller Tests to force a new context:

java
Copy
Edit
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.BEFORE_CLASS)
Switch to @WebMvcTest to isolate the web layer in controller tests.

Ensure Kafka is properly shut down before controller tests start.

Use distinct profiles for Cucumber and controller tests and confirm in logs.

Check for lingering static fields or manually created beans in Cucumber tests.

Run tests sequentially via Maven settings to avoid interference.

If you've already tried these solutions and are still facing issues, consider sharing:

The full error stack trace.
The profiles used for running the tests.
The order in which tests are executed.
Let me know if you need further assistance!

You said:
Yes, they are the  only tests which run after  cucumber tests
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since the controller tests are running after the Cucumber tests and are encountering the "bean already present" error, it's highly likely that the Cucumber tests are not properly cleaning up the Spring application context, leading to conflicts when the controller tests run.

Why This Happens?
Cucumber context is not fully shut down, causing lingering beans.
Kafka or other resources are still running, leading to re-initialization issues.
Spring TestContext caching the old context, which leads to bean duplication.
Static fields in Cucumber tests holding references to beans.
Solutions to Ensure Clean Context for Controller Tests
1. Force Context Destruction After Cucumber Tests
Even if you're calling context.close() manually in Cucumber tests, Spring may not fully dispose of the context. Use @DirtiesContext to ensure a fresh context for the next set of tests.

Example: Apply to Cucumber Test Class

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
Explanation:

Forces Spring to discard the context after all Cucumber scenarios.
2. Close Application Context in @AfterAll Hook in Cucumber Tests
Ensure the context is fully closed after all scenarios finish.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanUp(CucumberIntegrationTest testInstance) {
    if (testInstance.context.isActive()) {
        testInstance.context.close();
        System.out.println("Cucumber context closed.");
    }
}
3. Properly Shut Down Kafka and Other Services
If you're using Embedded Kafka, ensure it's properly stopped, as it can leave open ports and threads.

Example in Cucumber Hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.kafka.test.EmbeddedKafkaBroker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CucumberTestHooks {

    @Autowired
    private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown(CucumberTestHooks hooks) {
        if (hooks.embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
            hooks.embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
            System.out.println("Embedded Kafka broker shut down.");
        }
    }
}
Additional cleanup:
Manually shutting down Kafka consumers and producers:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

@AfterAll
public void shutdownKafkaClients() {
    kafkaTemplate.destroy();
}
4. Run Tests Sequentially to Prevent Shared State
Ensure that Cucumber and controller tests are not running in parallel by configuring Maven.

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Run the tests sequentially:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
5. Check for Static Fields Holding Context References
If any step definitions have static fields holding beans or application context, they might persist across tests.

Example to check:

java
Copy
Edit
public class StepDefinitions {

    private static SomeBean myBean;  // This might retain across tests

    @Autowired
    public void setMyBean(SomeBean bean) {
        myBean = bean;
    }
}
Solution:
Explicitly reset static fields in @AfterAll:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void resetStaticFields() {
    StepDefinitions.myBean = null;
}
6. Use Separate Profiles for Tests
Make sure the profiles are correctly used for test isolation.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
In application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
And in application-cucumber.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:cucumberdb
7. Verify Context Isolation via Logging
Enable Spring debug logging to track if the context is being reloaded properly.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.context=TRACE
Run the tests and observe logs for:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Closing org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
If this message is missing, it means the context isn't being properly closed.

8. Remove Unnecessary Beans from Controller Tests
If you are using @SpringBootTest in the controller tests, consider switching to @WebMvcTest to limit bean loading to only web layer components.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}
9. Add Test Cleanup Listeners
Implement a test listener to clean up beans forcefully.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.test.context.TestContext;
import org.springframework.test.context.support.AbstractTestExecutionListener;

public class CleanupTestExecutionListener extends AbstractTestExecutionListener {

    @Override
    public void afterTestClass(TestContext testContext) throws Exception {
        testContext.getApplicationContext().close();
        System.out.println("Application context closed after Cucumber tests.");
    }
}
Use it in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestExecutionListeners(CleanupTestExecutionListener.class)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
10. Run Cucumber Tests After Controller Tests
Instead of running controller tests after Cucumber tests, reverse the order.

You can achieve this by:

Using Maven Failsafe plugin for Cucumber tests and Surefire for unit tests.
Running tests via script:
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test -Dgroups=unit
mvn test -Dgroups=cucumber
Conclusion and Next Steps
To resolve the "bean already present" issue when controller tests run after Cucumber tests:

Ensure proper shutdown:

Use @DirtiesContext on Cucumber tests.
Manually close the application context in @AfterAll.
Properly shut down Embedded Kafka and consumers.
Isolate contexts:

Use separate profiles for Cucumber and controller tests.
Use @WebMvcTest for controller tests to reduce scope.
Run tests sequentially:

Configure Maven to avoid parallel test execution.
Check static fields:

Ensure no lingering bean references in static fields.
Enable debug logging to confirm context shutdown.

You said:
All the controller tests  are annotated using @sprinboottests
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since all your controller tests are annotated with @SpringBootTest, it means that they are loading the full application context, which includes all beans defined in your application. This can lead to conflicts if the context is not properly isolated or cleaned up after previous tests, such as Cucumber tests.

Solutions to Avoid Bean Conflicts in Controller Tests
1. Force Context Refresh Using @DirtiesContext
Since your controller tests are running after the Cucumber tests, the application context might not be properly reset. Adding @DirtiesContext to the Cucumber tests ensures a fresh context for controller tests.

Solution:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class CucumberIntegrationTest {
}
2. Isolate Context Loading in Controller Tests
If your controller tests do not depend on the entire application context, consider limiting the beans that get loaded.

Instead of using:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {
}
Try:

java
Copy
Edit
@WebMvcTest(MyController.class)
public class ControllerTest {
}
Benefits:

Only loads web-related components such as controllers and related beans.
Reduces conflicts with beans loaded in previous tests.
3. Use @MockBean to Override Conflicting Beans
If the same beans are being loaded in both Cucumber and controller tests, you can override them using @MockBean to prevent conflicts.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class ControllerTest {

    @MockBean
    private SomeService someService;

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;
}
4. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Context Conflicts
Ensure that tests do not run in parallel by configuring Maven Surefire plugin to enforce sequential execution.

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
5. Manually Close Application Context in Cucumber Tests
Even if Spring's context shutdown is triggered, some beans may continue to persist. You can manually close the context after Cucumber tests.

Example in Cucumber Hooks:

java
Copy
Edit
import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CucumberHooks {

    @Autowired
    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        if (context.isActive()) {
            context.close();
            System.out.println("Cucumber test context closed.");
        }
    }
}
6. Check for Overlapping Bean Definitions
Inspect your @SpringBootApplication and @SpringBootTest annotations to ensure that beans are not being scanned unnecessarily across multiple tests.

Example Solution:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true")
public class ControllerTest {
}
7. Use Separate Profiles for Tests
Ensure that separate profiles are used for Cucumber and controller tests to avoid bean loading conflicts.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class ControllerTest {
}

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("cucumber")
public class CucumberTest {
}
Properties files:

application-test.properties (for controller tests)
application-cucumber.properties (for Cucumber tests)
8. Verify Context Shutdown via Logging
Enable debug logging to confirm whether the context is properly destroyed after Cucumber tests.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.context=TRACE
Look for logs such as:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Closing org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
If the context is not closing, manual intervention might be required.

9. Use SpringApplication.exit() to Ensure Proper Shutdown
In Cucumber tests, call SpringApplication.exit() to ensure all beans and resources are released.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void stopApplication() {
    SpringApplication.exit(context);
}
10. Disable Auto-Configuration for Unwanted Beans
If certain beans are not required in controller tests, you can exclude them from auto-configuration.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(excludeAutoConfiguration = {KafkaAutoConfiguration.class})
public class ControllerTest {
}
Conclusion and Recommendations
Force context cleanup using @DirtiesContext after Cucumber tests.
Switch to @WebMvcTest for controller tests to minimize bean loading.
Ensure sequential test execution to avoid shared context issues.
Use separate profiles (test, cucumber) for better test isolation.
Manually close application context in Cucumber tests to release resources.
Enable logging to debug bean loading and destruction for deeper insights.

You said:
Can we tell it not load existing beans
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can prevent Spring from loading existing beans when running tests by using various strategies depending on your needs. Below are different approaches to achieve this:

1. Use @MockBean to Replace Existing Beans
If you want to prevent actual bean instances from being loaded and instead provide mocked versions, you can use @MockBean in your test class.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class MyTest {

    @MockBean
    private MyService myService;  // Prevents real MyService bean from being loaded

    @Autowired
    private MyController myController;

    @Test
    public void testController() {
        when(myService.getData()).thenReturn("mocked data");
        // Test logic here
    }
}
How it helps:

Overrides any existing bean with a mock implementation, effectively disabling the actual bean.
2. Use @SpringBootTest with Explicit Bean Selection
Instead of loading all beans, specify only the necessary configurations by using the classes attribute in @SpringBootTest.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = {MyController.class, TestConfig.class})
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

Loads only the specified beans and excludes the rest.
3. Use @Import to Limit Beans Loaded
Instead of scanning the entire application, explicitly import only required configurations.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@Import({TestConfig.class})
public class MyTest {
}
Test Configuration Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class TestConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
How it helps:

Ensures only beans in TestConfig are loaded and prevents auto-configuration of other beans.
4. Use @ComponentScan with Exclusion Filters
You can exclude specific packages or beans from being loaded by using the excludeFilters attribute in @ComponentScan.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example",
    excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value = UnwantedBean.class))
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

Prevents specific beans from being included in the test context.
5. Use @Profile to Condition Bean Loading
Define beans in a way that they are loaded only for specific profiles and excluded for test profiles.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!test")  // Exclude this bean when 'test' profile is active
public class ExcludedBeanConfig {

    @Bean
    public UnwantedBean unwantedBean() {
        return new UnwantedBean();
    }
}
Test Class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

The unwanted bean will not be loaded when the test profile is active.
6. Use @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {...})
If certain auto-configured beans are causing issues, you can exclude them explicitly.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class, KafkaAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

Prevents the specified auto-configuration classes from being loaded.
7. Disable Specific Beans via Properties
In application.properties or application.yml, you can disable certain beans by setting their related properties.

Example (application-test.properties):

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.enabled=false
feature.some-bean.enabled=false
Bean Configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.some-bean.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
public SomeBean someBean() {
    return new SomeBean();
}
How it helps:

The bean is conditionally loaded based on property value.
8. Use @TestConfiguration for Test-Specific Beans
You can override existing beans or define test-specific beans by using @TestConfiguration.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestConfiguration
public class MyTestConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public MyService myTestService() {
        return new MyService();  // A different instance than the default one
    }
}
In your test:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@Import(MyTestConfig.class)
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

It ensures test-specific beans override the actual beans.
9. Use ContextCustomizer for Fine-Grained Bean Control
Spring allows programmatic exclusion of beans before context initialization.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
public class CustomTestContextCustomizer implements ContextCustomizer {
    @Override
    public void customizeContext(ConfigurableApplicationContext context, MergedContextConfiguration mergedConfig) {
        BeanDefinitionRegistry registry = (BeanDefinitionRegistry) context.getBeanFactory();
        registry.removeBeanDefinition("myBeanToExclude");
    }
}
Usage in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ContextCustomizerFactory(CustomTestContextCustomizer.class)
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

Provides fine-grained control over bean inclusion/exclusion programmatically.
10. Using ContextConfiguration for Selective Bean Loading
If you want to load specific configurations without the full Spring Boot context, use @ContextConfiguration.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {MyController.class, MyServiceMockConfig.class})
public class MyTest {
}
How it helps:

Prevents the full application context from being initialized.
Conclusion: Recommended Approach Based on Needs
Scenario	Recommended Solution
Avoid loading specific beans	Use @ComponentScan with excludeFilters
Load only required beans	Use @SpringBootTest(classes = {...})
Mock specific beans to prevent loading	Use @MockBean
Prevent auto-configured beans	Use @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {...})
Load beans conditionally	Use @Profile or @ConditionalOnProperty
Fine-grained control over bean registration	Use ContextCustomizer
Let me know if you need more guidance on implementing any of these solutions!

You said:
No,  just to advice do not load beans which are already loaded
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to prevent Spring from loading beans that are already loaded in the application context, you can use the following strategies to ensure that duplicate bean registration does not occur during test execution.

1. Use spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding Property
Spring Boot provides a property to allow or disallow bean overriding. You can set it to false to prevent Spring from re-registering beans that are already loaded.

In application.properties or application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false
Explanation:

When set to false, if a bean is already defined in the context and an attempt is made to load it again, Spring will throw an exception to prevent duplication.
This is the easiest way to prevent duplicate bean loading.
2. Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean to Prevent Redundant Loading
Spring allows beans to be conditionally loaded only if they are not already present in the context.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean(MyService.class)
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Explanation:

The bean will only be loaded if it has not already been registered in the context.
This approach ensures that tests do not reinitialize beans unnecessarily.
3. Use @Primary to Control Which Bean is Used
If multiple beans of the same type exist, you can use @Primary to ensure the correct bean is used, while others are ignored.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@Primary
public MyService myPrimaryService() {
    return new MyService();
}
Explanation:

If multiple beans exist, the one marked with @Primary will take precedence.
Spring will avoid conflicts and only use the primary bean.
4. Use @MockBean to Override Existing Beans
If you don't want to reinitialize existing beans in test contexts, you can use @MockBean to replace them with a mock version.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
public class MyTest {

    @MockBean
    private MyService myService;  // Prevents the actual bean from being reloaded

    @Autowired
    private MyController myController;
}
Explanation:

@MockBean prevents the existing bean from being reloaded by replacing it with a mock instance.
5. Use Profiles to Exclude Beans Already Loaded
Define beans with specific profiles and exclude them based on the active profile.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!test")
public class MyConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
In your test:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class MyTest {
}
Explanation:

This approach prevents production beans from loading in test scenarios if they are already part of a different profile.
6. Use ApplicationContext.containsBean() to Prevent Reloading
If you're manually registering beans, check if they already exist in the context before adding them.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

@Bean
public MyService myService() {
    if (!context.containsBean("myService")) {
        return new MyService();
    }
    return (MyService) context.getBean("myService");
}
Explanation:

Ensures the bean is only created if it's not already present.
7. Use excludeFilters in @ComponentScan to Avoid Duplicate Scanning
If beans are being reloaded due to component scanning, exclude already-loaded packages.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example",
    excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value = MyService.class))
public class MyTest {
}
Explanation:

Prevents Spring from scanning and loading specific beans that are already in the context.
8. Use @TestConfiguration to Override Beans in Test Context
If tests require specific beans, you can override them using @TestConfiguration without reloading existing ones.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@TestConfiguration
public class TestConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Explanation:

Only beans defined in TestConfig will be loaded, avoiding reloading existing ones.
9. Use @SpringBootTest(classes = {}) to Limit Context Initialization
You can specify exactly which beans should be loaded, preventing redundant ones.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest(classes = {MyController.class, MyTestConfig.class})
public class MyTest {
}
Explanation:

This approach loads only the specified beans, ensuring existing ones are not reloaded.
10. Enable Lazy Initialization to Avoid Premature Bean Creation
You can enable lazy initialization globally to prevent beans from being loaded unless explicitly required.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true
Bean Definition:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@Lazy
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyService();
}
Explanation:

Beans will only be initialized when they are accessed, reducing redundant initialization.
Conclusion: Recommended Approaches
Scenario	Solution
Prevent loading already present beans	Set spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false
Conditionally load beans only if missing	Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean
Prevent duplicate bean scanning	Use @ComponentScan with exclusions
Prevent duplicate auto-configuration	Use @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {...})
Manage duplicate bean definition in tests	Use @MockBean or @TestConfiguration
Use profiles to isolate context	Use @Profile annotations
Lazy load beans to avoid unnecessary instantiation	Use @Lazy or spring.main.lazy-initialization
Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

You said:
Getting error creating a bean, because a instance variable in that bean already exists
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're encountering an error when creating a bean because an instance variable in that bean already exists, it typically means one of the following issues is happening:

Spring is creating multiple instances of the bean, leading to conflicts.
The bean contains a static or singleton field that is not being properly reset.
Circular dependencies or incorrect dependency injection are causing unintended bean creation.
The same bean is being defined multiple times due to misconfigurations.
Solutions to Resolve the Issue
1. Ensure Singleton Scope and Proper Bean Management
If the bean is meant to be a singleton, make sure it is properly defined as such and that no duplicate definitions exist.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
@Scope("singleton")  // Ensures only one instance of the bean
public class MyBean {
    private final SomeDependency dependency;

    public MyBean(SomeDependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }
}
Solution:
Ensure that you have not accidentally created the bean multiple times via different configurations.
2. Check for Static Fields Holding Old References
If your bean contains a static field that is initialized and retained across test runs, it might cause issues.

Example (Problematic Code):
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyBean {
    private static MyService myService;

    public MyBean(MyService service) {
        myService = service;  // Static field holding old reference
    }
}
Solution:
Avoid using static fields in Spring-managed beans.
If static fields are necessary, reset them manually in @PreDestroy or before tests.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() {
    myService = null;
}
3. Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean to Prevent Duplicate Creation
Spring allows you to conditionally create beans only if they do not already exist.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
Solution:
This ensures that the bean is not created again if it already exists in the context.
4. Ensure Proper Context Cleanup Between Tests
If you are running tests and encountering bean creation errors, it might be due to improper cleanup of the application context.

Solution:
Use @DirtiesContext to reset the context between test runs.
java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyTest {
}
5. Use @Lazy to Defer Bean Initialization
If your bean is being created too early, causing conflicts, consider marking it as lazy.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
@Lazy
public class MyBean {
    @Autowired
    private SomeDependency dependency;
}
Solution:
This ensures that the bean is created only when it is first accessed.
6. Verify Dependency Injection and Circular References
Sometimes, circular dependencies can lead to unexpected bean creation behavior.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class BeanA {
    @Autowired
    private BeanB beanB;
}

@Component
public class BeanB {
    @Autowired
    private BeanA beanA;
}
Solution:
Use @Lazy to break circular dependencies.
Refactor to use constructor injection with optional dependencies.
java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class BeanB {
    private final BeanA beanA;

    public BeanB(@Lazy BeanA beanA) {
        this.beanA = beanA;
    }
}
7. Prevent Component Scanning from Re-Loading the Bean
If your bean is being loaded twice due to overlapping component scanning, exclude the package or class.

Solution:
java
Copy
Edit
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example",
    excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value = MyBean.class))
public class AppConfig {
}
8. Debug Bean Definition with Application Context
You can inspect which beans are loaded and whether there are duplicate definitions.

Solution:
Add a debugging point in your test or main application:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

public void checkBeans() {
    for (String beanName : context.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
        System.out.println(beanName);
    }
}
Look for multiple entries of the same bean.

9. Remove Bean Definition Overriding
If your application allows overriding beans, you can disable it to avoid unwanted duplication.

Solution:
Set in application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false
10. Inspect Factory Methods or Manual Bean Creation
If you're manually creating beans using new keyword instead of relying on Spring, it may lead to duplicate beans.

Solution:
Ensure all beans are defined through Spring context.

Problematic Code:

java
Copy
Edit
MyBean bean = new MyBean();
Corrected Code:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private MyBean myBean;
Conclusion: Recommended Steps to Fix the Issue
Check for duplicate bean definitions using logs or context inspection.
Remove static fields or reset them manually during cleanup.
Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean to prevent duplicate creation.
Use @DirtiesContext in tests to refresh the application context.
Disable bean overriding via spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false.
Ensure proper dependency injection and avoid manual bean instantiation.
Exclude the bean from scanning if it is being loaded multiple times.
If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about the exact error message and bean definition. Let me know if you need further assistance!

You said:
Conditionalonmissing will it have more precedence than properties. File
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The behavior of @ConditionalOnMissingBean versus property-based bean conditions (e.g., @ConditionalOnProperty) depends on the order of bean initialization and the Spring context loading process. Here's how their precedence works:

1. Behavior of @ConditionalOnMissingBean
This condition checks if a bean of the specified type does not already exist in the Spring application context.
It takes effect at runtime, meaning it checks the context dynamically before registering the bean.
If a bean is manually registered or auto-configured elsewhere, @ConditionalOnMissingBean will prevent another registration.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Behavior:

If MyService is already defined elsewhere (via another config or autowiring), this bean will not be created.
Precedence: Checks at runtime after properties have been processed and beans are about to be registered.
2. Behavior of @ConditionalOnProperty (Property-Based Conditions)
This annotation checks the presence or value of a specific property in the application.properties or application.yml file.
It takes effect at configuration loading time, meaning before bean definitions are processed.
If the property condition fails, the bean will not be registered at all, preventing it from even being considered later by @ConditionalOnMissingBean.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = false)
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Behavior:

If feature.enabled=false (or not set), the bean will not be registered at all.
Precedence: Takes effect earlier in the bean lifecycle.
3. Precedence Order (Which Takes Effect First?)
Condition Type	Phase	Precedence
@ConditionalOnProperty	During configuration loading	Higher
@ConditionalOnMissingBean	During bean registration	Lower
Conclusion:

If a property condition fails, the bean is not registered at all.
Thus, @ConditionalOnProperty takes precedence because it determines whether a bean should even be considered.
If a bean conditionally exists (due to manual registration or another auto-config setup), @ConditionalOnMissingBean will ensure it's not created again.
4. Combining Both for Fine-Grained Control
If you want to ensure that a bean is only created if both a property is enabled and it doesn't already exist, you can combine both annotations:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = false)
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
Behavior:

The bean will be created only if:
The property feature.enabled=true
There is no existing bean of type MyService
5. Use Case Scenarios
Use @ConditionalOnProperty when:

You want to control bean creation based on external configuration.
You want the bean to be skipped entirely if a property is disabled.
Example: Feature toggles, environment-based configuration.
Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean when:

You want to ensure the bean is created only if no other instance exists.
You want to allow manual bean overrides by the user.
Example: Default implementation if none is provided.
6. How to Debug Precedence Issues
If you're unsure which condition is affecting your bean:

Enable debug logging in application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
Observe logs for bean registration messages, such as:

python
Copy
Edit
Bean 'myService' not registered due to property condition
7. Summary
@ConditionalOnProperty has higher precedence because it evaluates during configuration phase.
@ConditionalOnMissingBean is evaluated later when Spring attempts to register the bean.
Combining both annotations provides fine-grained control over bean creation.

Whats execution in plugins in pom.xml
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In Maven, the <executions> element inside a <plugin> configuration in the pom.xml file is used to bind specific plugin goals to the build lifecycle phases, allowing you to control when and how a plugin is executed during the build process.

1. Structure of <executions> in Maven Plugin
An execution consists of the following key elements:

<id> – A unique identifier for the execution.
<phase> – The build lifecycle phase when the goal should be executed (e.g., compile, test, package, install, etc.).
<goals> – The goals of the plugin to execute.

                        <target>11</target>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
Explanation:

The <execution> block with id="compile-java" binds the compile goal of the maven-compiler-plugin to the compile phase.
During mvn compile, this execution will run and compile Java source files.
Example 2: Running a Custom Goal in the Build Process
If you want to generate documentation or other artifacts at a specific stage of the build, you can configure it like this:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.3.1</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>generate-docs</id>
                    <phase>package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>javadoc</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <destDir>${project.build.directory}/docs</destDir>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
Explanation:

This execution generates Javadocs during the package phase and saves them in the target/docs directory.
3. Common Maven Build Phases Where Plugin Executions Are Used
Some commonly used lifecycle phases where plugin executions can be configured:

Phase	Description
validate	Validates project setup.
compile	Compiles source code.
test	Runs unit tests.
package	Packages the compiled code into JAR/WAR.
verify	Verifies integrations, compliance tests.
install	Installs the built artifact in the local repo.
deploy	Deploys the artifact to a remote repository.
4. Skipping or Controlling Plugin Execution
You can skip plugin execution using:

Maven property (for specific executions):
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn package -DskipTests
In pom.xml:
xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <skipTests>true</skipTests>
</configuration>
5. Multiple Executions of the Same Plugin
If you need to run the same plugin in different phases with different configurations, you can define multiple <execution> blocks.

Example:

xml
Copy
Edit
<executions>
    <execution>
        <id>compile-sources</id>
        <phase>compile</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>compile</goal>
        </goals>
    </execution>
    <execution>
        <id>test-compile</id>
        <phase>test-compile</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>testCompile</goal>
        </goals>
    </execution>
</executions>
6. Example of Skipping Tests for Specific Execution
If you want to skip tests only for the package phase:

xml
Copy
Edit
<executions>
    <execution>
        <id>default-test</id>
        <phase>test</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>test</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <skipTests>true</skipTests>
        </configuration>
    </execution>
</executions>
7. Checking Plugin Executions in Maven
To check which plugins are being executed during the build, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -X
This will show detailed logs including plugin executions and phases.

8. Why Use Plugin Executions?
To automate repetitive tasks such as code generation, formatting, or packaging.
To control the build lifecycle, ensuring tasks are run at the right time.
To modify the behavior of existing build phases, such as skipping tests or adding logging.
To run additional custom build steps, such as copying resources or performing checks.
9. When Not to Use Executions
Avoid unnecessary plugin executions if:

The default behavior of the plugin suits your needs.
You are running the same plugin multiple times without changes.
Performance is critical (extra executions can slow down builds).
Conclusion
<executions> in Maven plugins allow you to bind specific plugin goals to lifecycle phases.
Use <phase> to define when the plugin should run.
Use <goals> to specify what the plugin should execute.
You can have multiple executions to perform different tasks at different phases.
Controlling executions properly can improve build efficiency and maintainability.
Let me know if you need further clarification!

You said:
The controller tests which are failing have  class name ending with integrationtest.java and have a execution  in pom.xml can this effect their tests
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the fact that your controller tests have class names ending with *IntegrationTest.java and are associated with an execution block in pom.xml can indeed affect their behavior and execution order.

1. Why It Matters: Maven Failsafe vs. Surefire Plugin
Maven typically uses two plugins for running tests:

maven-surefire-plugin (for unit tests, runs during the test phase)
maven-failsafe-plugin (for integration tests, runs during the integration-test phase)
If your controller tests are named with the suffix *IntegrationTest.java, Maven might treat them as integration tests, which:

Will not run with unit tests (mvn test)

These tests will run during the integration-test phase instead of the test phase.
Might be configured to run separately based on an execution block in pom.xml.

This can lead to timing issues where the application context from previous tests is not properly reset.
2. Example Scenario of Affected Execution
Check your pom.xml to see if you have an execution block for the Failsafe plugin similar to:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Unit tests using Surefire plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>unit-tests</id>
                    <phase>test</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>test</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>

        <!-- Integration tests using Failsafe plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>integration-tests</id>
                    <phase>integration-test</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>integration-test</goal>
                        <goal>verify</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
Impact on Your Tests
Separation of Phases:

Unit tests run first in the test phase.
Integration tests run later in the integration-test phase.
If the context from unit tests is not properly cleaned up, the integration tests might fail.
Test Skipping:

If you're running mvn test, the integration tests may not run at all unless you run mvn verify.
Context Conflicts:

Since integration tests run later, they might attempt to reinitialize application contexts that were already created by unit tests.
3. How to Fix or Investigate
Option 1: Ensure Proper Context Cleanup
If your controller tests run after Cucumber tests, ensure that the context is properly cleaned between phases:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyControllerIntegrationTest {
}
This ensures a new context for each test execution phase.

Option 2: Rename Tests to Ensure Execution in Correct Phase
If you don't want the tests to run in the integration-test phase, rename them to avoid the *IntegrationTest suffix, which is used by convention by the Failsafe plugin.

Example:

Rename MyControllerIntegrationTest.java → MyControllerTest.java
This ensures that they are executed as unit tests with Surefire.

Option 3: Control Execution via Profiles
You can control the test execution via Maven profiles to separate unit and integration tests.

Example:

xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>integration-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <phase>integration-test</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>integration-test</goal>
                                <goal>verify</goal>
                            </goals>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Run integration tests separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean verify -Pintegration-tests
Option 4: Disable Automatic Execution
If the integration tests should not run automatically and are causing issues, you can skip their execution by adding:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <skip>true</skip>
</configuration>
Run tests manually when needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn verify -DskipTests=false
4. Key Takeaways
Yes, the execution block in pom.xml can affect test execution, especially if they are classified as integration tests.
Integration tests run in the integration-test phase, which may introduce context conflicts with previous unit tests.
You can rename the tests or control their execution through profiles to resolve conflicts.
Check mvn test vs. mvn verify to understand which tests are running when.
Ensure proper cleanup using @DirtiesContext to avoid conflicts between phases.

You said:
But its in maven-surefire-plugin
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your controller tests with names ending in *IntegrationTest.java are configured in the maven-surefire-plugin execution block, this can indeed affect their behavior. Normally, Surefire is responsible for running unit tests, but if an execution block in pom.xml is controlling when and how they run, it might cause unintended consequences.

1. How the Execution Block in Surefire Affects Tests
When you define a custom <execution> block inside the maven-surefire-plugin, it determines when and which tests should be run during the Maven build lifecycle.

Example Configuration in pom.xml:
xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>run-integration-tests</id>
                    <phase>verify</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>test</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*IntegrationTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
Impact on Test Execution:
Tests Will Run at the verify Phase Instead of test:

Normally, Surefire runs tests in the test phase, but with this configuration, tests matching *IntegrationTest.java will run only in the verify phase (after packaging).
This means if you run mvn test, these tests won't run, potentially causing issues if they're expected earlier.
Context Retention Issues:

If the same tests are run twice (once in test and again in verify), it may lead to application context conflicts.
Selective Test Execution:

If the includes filter specifies only *IntegrationTest.java, other tests may be skipped inadvertently.
2. Solutions to Avoid Issues
Option 1: Run All Tests Together
If you want both unit and integration tests to run together, remove the <execution> block and rely on the default behavior:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
</plugin>
Option 2: Use Maven Profiles to Separate Tests
Instead of using <execution> directly, define profiles to control test execution separately.

Example in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>integration-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <phase>verify</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>test</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <includes>
                                    <include>**/*IntegrationTest.java</include>
                                </includes>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Run tests separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Run unit tests
mvn clean test

# Run integration tests
mvn verify -Pintegration-tests
Option 3: Ensure Context Cleanup Between Test Phases
If the tests are failing due to context issues (e.g., due to tests running at different phases), use @DirtiesContext to clean up between test executions.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyControllerIntegrationTest {
}
Option 4: Rename Tests to Follow Conventions
If you do not want the tests to be affected by the Surefire execution block, rename them to avoid the *IntegrationTest suffix, which triggers their execution in the verify phase.

Example:

Rename MyControllerIntegrationTest.java → MyControllerTest.java
Option 5: Ensure Proper Execution with Explicit Phase in Commands
If you want to ensure tests run in their expected phase without interference, always invoke the correct phases:

To run unit tests (executed by default in the test phase):

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test
To run integration tests manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean verify
3. Key Differences Between Surefire and Failsafe Plugin
Feature	Surefire Plugin (Unit Tests)	Failsafe Plugin (Integration Tests)
Default test phase	test	integration-test and verify
Test naming convention	*Test.java	*IT.java, *IntegrationTest.java
Handles test failures	Fails build on failure	Doesn't fail build, continues to verify
Used for	Fast unit tests	Long-running integration tests
If your project follows these conventions, switching to the failsafe plugin for integration tests might be beneficial.

4. Recommended Next Steps
Check the execution block in pom.xml – Is it forcing tests to run at verify?
Ensure you are using the correct phase when running tests.
Use Maven profiles for better separation of test types.
Consider renaming test classes to avoid unwanted execution.
Clean up the application context between different test phases to avoid conflicts.
5. How to Verify Which Tests Are Running
Run Maven with debug logging to see exactly which tests are being picked up by Surefire:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -X
Look for logs like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M7:test (default-test) ---
[INFO] Running com.example.MyControllerTest
Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance in fixing the issue!

You said:
Seems the classes in the integration-tests phase are failing
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your integration tests (running in the integration-test phase via the maven-surefire-plugin) are failing, it suggests possible issues related to test isolation, resource conflicts, or incorrect execution order. Below are potential causes and solutions to address the failures.

1. Potential Causes of Integration Test Failures
a) Application Context Conflicts
If the application context isn't properly reset between unit and integration tests, the integration tests might encounter errors such as:

Bean definition conflicts
Port binding issues (e.g., Kafka, databases)
Static variables holding stale data
Solution:
Use @DirtiesContext to force a new context before running integration tests.

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
b) Resources Not Released Properly
If the unit tests run first and do not release resources (such as an embedded database, message brokers, etc.), integration tests might fail due to resource conflicts.

Solution:

Explicitly shut down services in @AfterAll or @PreDestroy hooks.

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanup() {
    myDatabaseConnection.close();
}
If using Embedded Kafka, ensure proper shutdown:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EmbeddedKafkaBroker embeddedKafkaBroker;

@AfterAll
public static void shutdownKafka() {
    if (embeddedKafkaBroker != null) {
        embeddedKafkaBroker.destroy();
    }
}
c) Test Execution Order in Maven
If tests are executed out of expected order, integration tests might run before unit tests are fully cleaned up.

Solution:
Ensure sequential execution in pom.xml to avoid conflicts:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>unit-tests</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>integration-tests</id>
            <phase>integration-test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*IntegrationTest.java</include>
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
Key Takeaway: Ensure unit-tests run first, followed by integration-tests.

d) Profiles and Environment Misconfiguration
If integration tests rely on different configurations (e.g., test profile vs. production settings), there could be misconfigurations causing failures.

Solution:
Ensure proper profile usage in integration tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("integration")
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Check that application-integration.properties exists and is correctly configured.

e) Parallel Execution Causing Issues
If Maven is running tests in parallel, integration tests may face shared resource conflicts.

Solution:
Disable parallel execution in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Run tests with:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean verify -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
f) Database Issues (H2, PostgreSQL, etc.)
Integration tests often fail due to unclosed database connections, schema conflicts, or missing test data.

Solution:

Use an in-memory database like H2 for tests:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
Ensure schema is reset before tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@BeforeEach
void resetDatabase() {
    jdbcTemplate.execute("DELETE FROM my_table");
}
2. How to Troubleshoot Integration Test Failures
Enable Debug Logging
Add to application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
Check for Open Ports
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsof -i :8080
This will check if the test server port is still in use.

Run Tests Separately
Run unit tests first:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test
Then run integration tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn verify -Pintegration-tests
Inspect Surefire Reports
Look at target/surefire-reports for detailed stack traces.

3. Recommended Solutions Based on Common Scenarios
Issue	Solution
Context conflicts	Use @DirtiesContext after tests
Resource locking (Kafka, DB)	Ensure proper shutdown via @AfterAll
Execution order issues	Define execution phases in pom.xml
Profile misconfiguration	Use @ActiveProfiles for test-specific setup
Parallel test interference	Disable parallel execution in Maven
4. Sample Maven Configuration for Integration Tests
If you want to separate unit and integration tests cleanly, consider using Maven Failsafe plugin, which is designed specifically for integration tests.

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>integration-tests</id>
                    <phase>integration-test</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>integration-test</goal>
                        <goal>verify</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*IntegrationTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
Run tests separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test     # Unit tests
mvn clean verify   # Integration tests
5. Conclusion and Next Steps
Identify the root cause of failures:

Check logs (target/surefire-reports).
Run tests with debug logging (mvn verify -X).
Ensure proper test isolation:

Use @DirtiesContext and clean up resources properly.
Check Maven configuration:

You said:
A bean created using @Bean has a final field systemone, and seems when these integration tests run they see this fiel already present
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your integration tests are failing because a bean created using @Bean has a final field (e.g., systemone) that seems to be already present when the integration tests run, it suggests that the bean might not be getting properly reinitialized, and the same instance (or its dependencies) is being carried over across tests. This issue often occurs due to:

Spring Context Caching:

Integration tests might be reusing an old context where the systemone instance is already created.
Bean Scope Configuration:

The bean might be defined as a singleton when it should be recreated for each test.
Incorrect Context Cleanup:

Previous test contexts might not be fully destroyed before integration tests run.
Solution Approaches
1. Force Context Reset Using @DirtiesContext
If the same Spring context is being reused across tests, use @DirtiesContext to ensure a fresh context for the integration tests.

Apply it at the class level for integration tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Explanation:

Forces the application context to reset after the test class, ensuring that a fresh systemone is created for each test.
2. Use @Primary to Ensure Correct Bean Selection
If multiple beans of systemone exist in the context, ensure that the intended one is selected by marking it as @Primary.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
Explanation:

Ensures that only this instance is considered when resolving dependencies in tests.
3. Check for Static or Singleton Retention Issues
If the systemone instance is stored in a static field, it might persist across tests, causing issues.

Example (Problematic):

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class ActorService {
    private static final systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");
}
Solution:
Refactor to remove static initialization and inject via Spring.

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class ActorService {
    private final systemone systemone;

    public ActorService(systemone systemone) {
        this.systemone = systemone;
    }
}
4. Ensure Proper Bean Scope (Avoid Singleton If Needed)
If your systemone instance needs to be unique per test execution, consider changing its scope.

Solution:
Modify the bean definition to prototype scope to ensure a new instance is created for each test run.

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    @Scope("prototype")
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
Explanation:

prototype scope ensures that every time a bean is requested, a new instance is provided.
5. Clean Up systemone Manually in Tests
If the systemone is not being properly shutdown, it might persist across tests, causing failures.

Solution:
In your integration tests, ensure that the actor system is cleaned up.

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private systemone systemone;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanUp() {
    if (systemone != null) {
        systemone.terminate();
    }
}
6. Verify Bean Definition Overriding in Properties
If you're using Spring profiles, check if properties allow overriding bean definitions.

In application.properties or application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
Explanation:

Allows Spring to override beans during test execution, preventing conflicts.
7. Use ContextConfiguration to Load Only Needed Beans
To avoid loading unnecessary beans that might conflict with the systemone, selectively include the required beans for integration tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {systemoneConfig.class})
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Explanation:

Ensures only necessary configurations are loaded, avoiding duplicate bean creation.
8. Use Conditional Bean Creation
If the systemone should only be created when necessary, make it conditional based on environment properties.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(systemone.class)
public systemone systemone() {
    return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
}
Explanation:

Prevents the bean from being created if it already exists.
9. Run Tests Sequentially to Avoid Conflicts
If tests run in parallel, they might conflict when sharing the same actor system instance.

Solution in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>none</parallel>
    <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Run tests with:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
10. Inspect Spring Context for Duplicate Beans
You can log all beans to check if multiple systemone instances are being created.

Example to log bean instances:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

@Test
public void printAllBeans() {
    for (String beanName : context.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
        System.out.println("Bean: " + beanName);
    }
}
Explanation:

Helps identify if the same bean is being loaded multiple times.
Conclusion and Next Steps
Use @DirtiesContext to force fresh context loading.
Ensure proper cleanup of systemone instances after each test.
Verify bean scope; use prototype if necessary.
Check for static or singleton instances persisting across tests.
Log bean creation to identify duplicates.
Run tests sequentially to avoid conflicts.

You said:
This @Bean class is in a different maven module and it has final field systemone
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since the @Bean class with the final field systemone is in a different Maven module, the issue likely arises due to how Spring manages dependencies across multiple modules and class loading behavior. Here’s how to address it:

1. Potential Causes of the Issue
Singleton Bean in Shared Module:

If the bean is defined as a singleton, all modules that import it might share the same instance, leading to conflicts when the field (systemone) is already initialized.
Spring Context Overlap Across Modules:

When multiple modules include the same configuration, the bean might be instantiated multiple times in different contexts.
Immutable final Field Issues:

Since the field is final, Spring cannot reassign it, which could lead to dependency injection issues when the context is refreshed or reused across tests.
Circular Dependency Issues:

If different modules inject systemone in a circular manner, it could create unexpected behavior.
2. Solutions Based on Common Scenarios
Solution 1: Use @Lazy Initialization to Defer Bean Creation
If the systemone bean is being initialized eagerly in the shared module, marking it as @Lazy can help defer its creation until absolutely needed.

Example in the shared module (systemone-module):

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    @Lazy
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
Why this works:

Deferring bean creation ensures it is only instantiated when needed, reducing conflicts across multiple modules.
Solution 2: Define Bean Scope to Prototype in the Shared Module
If the bean is currently singleton, switch it to prototype to ensure a new instance for each module/test context.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    @Scope("prototype")
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
Why this works:

A new instance is created each time it is injected, preventing conflicts with the final field in test environments.
Solution 3: Isolate the Configuration with @Import
Instead of letting Spring auto-detect the bean across all modules, manually import it only where needed.

Example in consuming module (controller-module):

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@Import(systemoneConfig.class)
public class MyControllerIntegrationTest {
}
Why this works:

Ensures the bean is explicitly created only where needed, preventing unintended initialization in other modules.
Solution 4: Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean to Prevent Duplicate Beans
If the consuming modules include the shared module multiple times, this annotation ensures only one instance is created.

Example in the shared module (systemone-module):

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean(systemone.class)
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
Why this works:

Ensures that systemone is created only if it does not already exist in the Spring context.
Solution 5: Use Spring Profiles to Load Different Configurations in Tests
If the same configuration is being loaded across modules, define profiles to separate them.

In the shared module (systemone-module):

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@Profile("!test")
public class systemoneConfig {

    @Bean
    public systemone systemone() {
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }
}
In tests (set profile to test):

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Why this works:

Prevents the systemone bean from being loaded in test profiles when not required.
Solution 6: Ensure Proper Shutdown of systemone Between Tests
Since systemone is a resource-intensive component, failing to shut it down between tests can lead to failures due to existing instances.

Example in test teardown:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private systemone systemone;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanup() {
    if (systemone != null) {
        systemone.terminate();
    }
}
Why this works:

Ensures that resources are properly cleaned up before the next test.
Solution 7: Use Dependency Injection for systemone Initialization
If systemone is marked as final, Spring cannot reassign it after construction. Instead, consider constructor injection to manage initialization.

Example in shared module:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class MyActorService {
    private final systemone systemone;

    @Autowired
    public MyActorService(systemone systemone) {
        this.systemone = systemone;
    }
}
Why this works:

Avoids issues with immutable fields and allows dependency injection at the correct time.
Solution 8: Verify Bean Loading Using Logging
To check whether the systemone bean is being created multiple times, enable Spring logging to debug bean initialization.

In application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.springframework.beans=DEBUG
Run the tests and check the logs for duplicate bean creation messages.

Solution 9: Modularize Bean Creation by Dependency Injection
Instead of exposing the full configuration across modules, inject the systemone via constructor-based injection wherever required.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final systemone systemone;

    public MyService(systemone systemone) {
        this.systemone = systemone;
    }
}
3. Summary of Recommended Steps
Issue	Solution
Duplicate beans across modules	Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean
Context conflicts in tests	Use @DirtiesContext
Final field not injectable	Use constructor-based injection
Test failing due to existing instance	Ensure proper cleanup in @AfterAll
Profile conflicts	Use @ActiveProfiles to isolate configuration
4. Conclusion and Next Steps
To fix the integration test failures caused by the final field in the shared module:

Check bean scope: Use prototype scope to avoid singleton issues.
Properly clean up resources: Ensure systemone.terminate() is called after tests.
Isolate configuration: Use @Import to avoid unnecessary auto-scanning.
Profile-based configuration: Isolate test-specific configurations.
Logging: Debug bean creation to confirm if multiple instances exist.

You said:
No,  the @Bean is on EngineApp and engineapp has a final field systemone and both these classes are in another module and we cannot make systemones module depend on spring
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Got it! Your situation involves:

@Bean annotated class (EngineApp) defined in a different module.
EngineApp has a final systemone field.
The module containing systemone should not have a dependency on Spring.
This scenario creates a challenge because Spring cannot directly instantiate or manage the systemone dependency within the EngineApp class since it’s marked final and exists in a module that doesn't use Spring.

Solution Approaches to Handle Final Field Dependency
Since you cannot modify the systemone module to depend on Spring, you'll need to focus on how you create and inject EngineApp while managing the final systemone field effectively.

1. Use Factory Method for EngineApp in Spring Config
Instead of Spring creating EngineApp directly, you can provide an instance via a factory method, ensuring systemone is provided manually.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class EngineAppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp() {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");  // Manually create
        return new EngineApp(systemone);  // Inject systemone manually
    }
}
Why this works:

Allows Spring to manage the EngineApp instance without requiring the systemone module to depend on Spring.
You control the systemone lifecycle outside of Spring.
2. Provide systemone as a Parameterized Bean
If the systemone instance can be obtained externally, you can provide it as a constructor argument when defining the EngineApp bean.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class EngineAppConfig {

    private final systemone systemone;

    public EngineAppConfig(systemone systemone) {
        this.systemone = systemone;
    }

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp() {
        return new EngineApp(systemone);
    }
}
Why this works:

Keeps EngineApp inside the Spring container while injecting systemone from an external source.
3. Use Manual Instantiation and Registration in Spring Context
If you cannot inject systemone at bean creation, instantiate EngineApp manually and register it in the context.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
public class ManualBeanRegistrar implements ApplicationContextAware {

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");  // Create instance manually
        EngineApp engineApp = new EngineApp(systemone);

        ((GenericApplicationContext) applicationContext)
            .getBeanFactory()
            .registerSingleton("engineApp", engineApp);
    }
}
Register the above class as a Spring component:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class EngineAppInitializer {
    @Autowired
    public EngineAppInitializer(ApplicationContext context) {
        new ManualBeanRegistrar().setApplicationContext(context);
    }
}
Why this works:

Allows manual control over object creation and lifecycle management.
4. Use a Wrapper or Proxy Bean in Spring
Create a Spring-managed wrapper for EngineApp that initializes systemone manually.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class EngineAppWrapper {
    private final EngineApp engineApp;

    public EngineAppWrapper() {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");
        this.engineApp = new EngineApp(systemone);
    }

    public EngineApp getEngineApp() {
        return engineApp;
    }
}
Inject the wrapper in Spring-managed components:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EngineAppWrapper engineAppWrapper;

public void process() {
    EngineApp engineApp = engineAppWrapper.getEngineApp();
}
Why this works:

Provides a bridge between non-Spring dependencies and the Spring context.
5. Externalize the systemone Creation and Inject into EngineApp
If the systemone is already running externally (in another JVM process or service), retrieve it via dependency injection and inject it into EngineApp.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class EngineAppConfig {

    @Bean
    public systemone systemone() {
        // Assume externally initialized or accessed
        return systemone.create("Mysystemone");
    }

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp(systemone systemone) {
        return new EngineApp(systemone);
    }
}
Why this works:

Allows integration with externally managed components.
6. Use Spring Boot CommandLineRunner to Initialize Manually
Spring Boot allows manual initialization of components at application startup.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class EngineAppInitializer implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");
        EngineApp engineApp = new EngineApp(systemone);
        System.out.println("EngineApp initialized: " + engineApp);
    }
}
Why this works:

Runs custom logic at startup, avoiding automatic Spring bean creation.
7. Conditional Bean Creation to Avoid Conflicts
To avoid conflicts when running integration tests, ensure EngineApp is only created under certain conditions.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "engineapp.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public EngineApp engineApp() {
    return new EngineApp(systemone.create("Mysystemone"));
}
Set in application.properties during tests:

properties
Copy
Edit
engineapp.enabled=false
8. Ensuring Cleanup in Tests
Since systemone needs proper shutdown, ensure it's terminated correctly in tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@AfterAll
public static void cleanup(@Autowired EngineApp engineApp) {
    engineApp.getsystemone().terminate();
}

You said:
No both engineapp and systemone are in module with no dependency on spring, a bean of engineapp is created using@beqn in the main module is created which has spring dependency
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Thanks for the clarification. Since both EngineApp and systemone are in a non-Spring module, but an @Bean of EngineApp is created in the main module that has a Spring dependency, the issue likely arises due to the way Spring is managing the EngineApp instance and its final systemone field.

Challenges in Your Scenario
Final Field Initialization:

Since systemone is final, it must be initialized when constructing EngineApp. If a previous instance of EngineApp persists across tests, the final field cannot be reassigned, causing failures.
Spring Context Caching:

If the Spring context is not properly reset between tests, the same EngineApp instance might be reused with an already initialized systemone.
Bean Lifecycle Management:

Spring might be trying to re-instantiate EngineApp while retaining references to the existing systemone, leading to conflicts.
Solution Approaches
1. Ensure Proper Bean Definition in the Spring Module
When defining the EngineApp bean in your Spring-managed module, make sure that you properly inject the systemone when creating the bean.

Example in your Spring configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp() {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");  // Create systemone manually
        return new EngineApp(systemone);
    }
}
Why this works:

Ensures proper initialization within the Spring container while keeping systemone decoupled from Spring.
2. Use @DirtiesContext to Reset Context Between Tests
If the issue occurs because of Spring reusing the same context and bean, use @DirtiesContext to force context recreation.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Why this works:

Ensures that EngineApp is recreated with a fresh systemone in every test.
3. Manually Control Bean Lifecycle in Tests
In integration tests, manually create and destroy EngineApp to avoid conflicts.

Example in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

@Test
public void testEngineApp() {
    EngineApp engineApp = context.getBean(EngineApp.class);
    // Perform tests
    context.getAutowireCapableBeanFactory().destroyBean(engineApp);
}
Why this works:

Ensures proper bean destruction and avoids final field conflicts.
4. Use Factory Method for Controlled Initialization
Define a factory method for EngineApp to have full control over how the instance is created, ensuring that systemone is injected properly.

Example in Spring configuration:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp() {
        return EngineAppFactory.createEngineApp();
    }
}

public class EngineAppFactory {
    public static EngineApp createEngineApp() {
        systemone systemone = systemone.create("Mysystemone");
        return new EngineApp(systemone);
    }
}
Why this works:

Keeps bean creation flexible and independent of Spring.
5. Manage systemone Lifecycle Manually
Since systemone needs proper cleanup, ensure its termination when shutting down the Spring application.

Example using @PreDestroy:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EngineApp engineApp() {
        return new EngineApp(systemone.create("Mysystemone"));
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        engineApp().getsystemone().terminate();
    }
}
Why this works:

Prevents lingering systemone instances across tests.
6. Use Custom Bean Scoping to Avoid Reinitialization
If the EngineApp should not be shared across the entire application, define it with @Scope("prototype") to ensure a new instance per request.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public EngineApp engineApp() {
    return new EngineApp(systemone.create("Mysystemone"));
}
Why this works:

Each request for EngineApp gets a fresh instance, preventing conflicts.
7. Verify No Overlapping Bean Definitions
If the Spring context includes multiple configurations, ensure that EngineApp is not being created twice accidentally.

Example to check for duplicate beans:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class BeanVerifier implements CommandLineRunner {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) {
        String[] beans = context.getBeanNamesForType(EngineApp.class);
        System.out.println("Number of EngineApp beans: " + beans.length);
    }
}
Why this works:

Helps identify if the same bean is being instantiated multiple times.
8. Integration Testing Cleanup Strategy
In your integration test lifecycle, explicitly shut down the systemone after test execution to avoid field reuse issues.

Example in tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EngineApp engineApp;

@AfterAll
public static void cleanup() {
    engineApp.getsystemone().terminate();
}

Seems only thing which works is below , but that increases the build time a lot, any other mvn clean test -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Running your tests with the Maven options -DforkCount=1 -DreuseForks=false ensures that tests run sequentially without sharing JVM processes, which resolves context-related issues but indeed increases the build time significantly.

If you're looking to reduce build time while maintaining test isolation, consider the following alternative solutions:

1. Use Maven Surefire with Parallel Execution Control
Instead of disabling forks completely, you can control parallel execution to limit the number of forks and reuse strategies.

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
    <configuration>
        <forkCount>1C</forkCount>  <!-- Use 1 per available CPU core -->
        <reuseForks>true</reuseForks>
        <parallel>methods</parallel>  <!-- Run tests within the same class in parallel -->
        <threadCount>4</threadCount>  <!-- Use 4 threads for parallel execution -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
Explanation:

forkCount=1C: Uses 1 fork per CPU core instead of a single fork for all tests.
reuseForks=true: Ensures JVM processes are reused.
parallel=methods: Runs methods in the same class in parallel while avoiding context conflicts.
threadCount=4: Adjust to optimize based on machine resources.
Command to run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test
2. Use @DirtiesContext Selectively
Instead of resetting the context for all tests, use @DirtiesContext only where necessary, such as in integration tests.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)
public class MyIntegrationTest {
}
Benefits:

Reduces unnecessary reinitialization across unit tests.
Applies fresh context only for tests that modify state.
3. Use Profiles to Separate Unit and Integration Tests
Split your test execution based on Maven profiles, allowing unit tests to run quickly while running integration tests separately.

In pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit

    <profile>
        <id>unit-tests</id>

                        <forkCount>2</forkCount>
                        <reuseForks>true</reuseForks>
                    </configuration>

                            <include>**/*IT.java</include>
                        </includes>
                        <forkCount>1</forkCount>
                        <reuseForks=false</reuseForks>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
Commands to run separately:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -Punit-tests
mvn verify -Pintegration-tests
Benefits:

Speeds up unit tests without affecting integration tests.
Allows better resource allocation.
4. Leverage Test Containers for Isolation
If your tests depend on external resources (like databases, message brokers), consider using Testcontainers to create isolated environments per test without restarting the entire JVM.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Testcontainers
public class MyIntegrationTest {

    @Container
    public static GenericContainer<?> redis = 
        new GenericContainer<>("redis:latest").withExposedPorts(6379);

    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        assertTrue(redis.isRunning());
    }
}
Benefits:

Avoids full context reload by isolating dependencies.
Faster execution for individual tests.
5. Selective Context Loading with @ContextConfiguration
Instead of loading the entire Spring Boot context for every test, load only the required configurations.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {MySpecificConfig.class})
public class MyTest {
}
Benefits:

Reduces context initialization time.
Faster startup for tests.
6. Profile-based Context Initialization
Ensure that different profiles are used for tests and production to avoid unnecessary component scanning and initialization.

Example in application-test.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
spring.test.profile.active=test
In test class:

java
Copy
Edit
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class MyTest {
}
Benefits:

Loads a minimal set of beans, avoiding unnecessary components.
7. Test Execution Optimization with Test Suites
Instead of running all tests every time, organize them into suites for focused runs.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({
    UnitTest1.class,
    UnitTest2.class
})
public class UnitTestSuite {
}
Run specific test suites:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -Dtest=UnitTestSuite
Benefits:

Reduces the number of executed tests in frequent builds.
Faster build feedback cycles.
8. Run Tests in Multiple JVMs with Parallel Execution
If your machine has sufficient resources, consider running tests in parallel JVMs for better CPU utilization.

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <parallel>classes</parallel>
    <threadCount>2</threadCount>
    <forkCount>2</forkCount>
    <reuseForks>true</reuseForks>
</configuration>
Command to run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -T 2C
Benefits:

Parallel execution improves speed.
Efficient resource utilization.
9. Profile-Specific Exclusions for Faster Execution
Exclude tests based on profiles to run only relevant test categories.

Example in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<configuration>
    <excludedGroups>slow</excludedGroups>
</configuration>
Mark slow tests:

java
Copy
Edit
@Tag("slow")
@Test
public void slowTest() {
    // long-running test
}
Run without slow tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean test -DexcludedGroups=slow
Benefits:

Focus on fast tests during development cycles.
10. Use Build Cache for Faster Re-Runs
Leverage Maven build caching to avoid re-running unchanged tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn verify -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=false
Benefits:

Faster re-execution by skipping redundant builds.
Conclusion: Suggested Optimizations
Optimization Approach	Benefit
Parallel test execution	Faster execution, resource usage
Selective context resets	Avoid reloading unnecessary beans
Test suites and profile-based testing	Focused test runs, better timing
Factory-based bean creation	Improved lifecycle management
Testcontainers for isolation	Avoid context reloads
Recommended Approach:

Use parallel execution with limited threads and reuse forks.
Split tests using Maven profiles to separate unit and integration tests.
Optimize Spring Boot context with profile-specific configurations.
Use @DirtiesContext selectively rather than globally.
