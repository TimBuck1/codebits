untilDestroyed(this):

This is likely an operator from a library (e.g., ngx-take-until-destroyed) that ensures the observable subscription is automatically cleaned up when the component is destroyed. It prevents memory leaks by unsubscribing when the component is no longer active.
First map((citys) => { ... }):

This map operator is applied to the observable stream of citys, where citys is an array of objects (likely representing different citys).
The map function is used to transform each city object inside the array.
citys.map((city) => { ... }):

The inner map iterates over each city object within the citys array. It checks if the condition is met for each individual city.
if (condition):

This is a conditional statement that checks some condition on each city. If the condition is true, the city will be transformed accordingly.
const { disabled, ...enablecity } = city;:

This is destructuring assignment in TypeScript. It removes the disabled property from the city object and places the remaining properties in the enablecity object.
This effectively "enables" the city by removing the disabled property.
return enablecity;:

After removing disabled, the rest of the city properties are returned as enablecity. This means that, for citys that satisfy the condition, the returned object will not have the disabled property.
else { return { ...city, disabled: true }; }:

If the condition is not met, the city is returned with disabled: true. The city object is spread into a new object, and disabled is explicitly set to true. This is how you "disable" the city.
Second map((updatedcitys) => [ ...updatedcitys ]):

After the first map finishes, the updated citys array is passed to this second map.
This map operator wraps the updatedcitys array into a new array using the spread operator. It essentially transforms the updatedcitys into a new array and returns it.
This could be useful for ensuring that the observable emits an array of citys rather than a wrapped object.
...updatedcitys:

The spread operator is used to create a new array with the contents of updatedcitys. This step is necessary if you want to ensure that the array is spread out correctly when passed downstream in the observable chain.
